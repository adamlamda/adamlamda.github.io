They were to enter into the land of promise, and their descendants were to inherit it. The great lawgiver himself was to be excluded on account of his transgression. He does not, however, shrink from recording the sentence of exclusion in immediate connection with an incident which brings out that exclusion into greater prominence. The fulfilment of the announcement made to Moses is related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/32-48.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses that selfsame day, saying,">Deuteronomy 32:48-52</a>. The mountains of Abarim form the Moabitish table-land, the northern portion of which bore the name of Pisgah. It is here that we must look for Mount Nebo, which is sometimes described as one of the mountains of Abarim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-49.htm" title="Get you up into this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession:">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>), and at other times as the top of Pisgah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-27.htm" title="Get you up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.">Deuteronomy 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-1.htm" title="And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel</span>.--"The law," says Bishop Wordsworth, "led men to 'see the promises afar off, and to embrace them' [rather, <span class= "ital">to see and greet the promises from afar, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-13.htm" title="These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.">Hebrews 11:13</a>], and it brought them to the borders of Canaan, but could not bring them into it: that was reserved for Joshua, the type of Jesus." It must not be overlooked, however, that, although he was shut out during his lifetime from entering into the land of Canaan, Moses was permitted to stand with Elijah upon the Mount of Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-3.htm" title="And, behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.">Matthew 17:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto Moses. It</span> is impossible to determine the exact place of this announcement in the order of events narrated. It would appear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-1.htm">Numbers 31:1</a> that the war with the Midianites occurred later, and certainly the address to the people and to Joshua in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-1.htm">Deuteronomy 31:1-8</a> presupposes the formal appointment here recorded; but the chronologer of the concluding chapters of Numbers is evidently very uncertain; they may, or may not, be arranged in order of time. We may with good reason suppose that the summons to die was only separated from its fulfillment by the brief interval necessary to complete what work was yet unfinished (such as the punishment of the Midianites and the provisional settlement of the trans-Jordanic country) before the river was crossed. Into this Mount Abarim. See on Numbers 33:47; Deuteronomy 32:49 <span class="accented">sq.</span>, where this command is recited more in detail. Abarim was apparently the range behind the Arboth Moab, the northern portion of which opposite to Jericho was called Pisgah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-20.htm">Numbers 21:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-27.htm">Deuteronomy 3:27</a>), and the highest point Nebo (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>), after the name of a neighbouring town (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-47.htm">Numbers 33:47</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And see the land.</span> Moses had already been told that he should not enter the promised land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>), yet he is allowed the consolation of seeing it with his eyes before his death. It would seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-25.htm">Deuteronomy 3:25-27</a> that this favour was accorded him in answer to his prayer. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-11.htm">Abarim</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-20.htm">Ab'arim</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-17.htm">Ascend</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-11.htm">Children</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-11.htm">Israel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-11.htm">Israelites</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-11.htm">Moses</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Mount</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-22.htm">Mountain</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-35.htm">Range</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-44.htm">Abarim</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-47.htm">Ab'arim</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Ascend</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-20.htm">Children</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-20.htm">Israel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-40.htm">Israelites</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-18.htm">Moses</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-6.htm">Mount</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-6.htm">Mountain</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Range</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: Abarim and given Go have I in Israel Israelites land LORD Moses mountain of range said see sons the Then this to up which<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="27-12.htm">OT Law: Numbers 27:12 Yahweh said to Moses Go up into (Nu Num.)

It is enough that in the vision he manifests by the key and the chain which he carries that there is power in Him, who has the keys of death and of Hades (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm" title="I am he that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever more, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.">Revelation 1:18</a>), to bind, as He has death-wounded, him that had the power of death. The bottomless pit is the abyss, as we have had elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm" title="And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.">Revelation 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a>.

On account of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>, some have considered this angel to be Christ himself; but this is incorrect. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7-9</a>, an angel is the immediate agent in this expulsion of Satan (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Having the key of the bottomless pit;</span> <span class="accented">the abyss</span>; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1, 2, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>. In all these places the word signifies the present abode of Satan and his angels, whence they direct their operations in hostility to God, not the place of their final punishment (see ver. 10). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a> the word has exactly the same meaning; while in the only remaining place where it is used in the New Testament, viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm">Romans 10:7</a>, it stands for the place of abode of the souls of the dead. <span class="accented">Having the key of the abyss</span> therefore informs us that power is given to this angel over Satan during the time of this world's existence. <span class="cmt_word">And a great chain in his hand;</span> literally, <span class="accented">upon his hand</span>, as if lying on it and hanging from it; the chain evidently symbolizing the power of the angel over the inhabitants of the abyss, and the purpose with which he now comes, viz. to restrain the power of Satan. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Abyss</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-17.htm">Angel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-1.htm">Arm</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Bottomless</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-3.htm">Carried</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm">Chain</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm">Deep</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-1.htm">Descending</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-18.htm">Great</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-2.htm">Hand</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-17.htm">Heaven</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-2.htm">Holding</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm">Key</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Pit</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-3.htm">Abyss</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-15.htm">Angel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-15.htm">Arm</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Bottomless</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm">Carried</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Chain</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Deep</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm">Descending</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Great</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm">Hand</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-9.htm">Heaven</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-21.htm">Holding</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-25.htm">Key</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-2.htm">Pit</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: a Abyss an And angel chain coming down from great hand having heaven his holding I in key of out saw the Then to<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="20-1.htm">NT Prophecy: Revelation 20:1 I saw an angel coming down out (Rev.

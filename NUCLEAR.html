<p>&hellip; and <a href="https://twitter.com/moreblack666/status/1332930748253233152">someone else mentioned the bridge</a>; and to see to me it was not new like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st">the Bifrost</a> was nothing new; and still this one something spectactularly new and from the same place where this Valchallan &ldquo;Chivan bridge&rdquo; was now new just like the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ancient-giant-trees/">Tableland Monument</a>&rdquo; and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chenab_Bridge">Chenab real-comparitor.</a> Today the world and the people around me echo in almost perfect &hellip; pre-verberation the things I think about &hellip; the important ones&ndash;at least.</p>

<p>Few &ldquo;epiphanies&rdquo; have held a stronger hold on my viewpoint of what it means to change in understanding and meaning more than the unwritten in &ldquo;mass prose&rdquo; version of &ldquo;vitsivanu&rdquo;&ndash;which today I still believe means &ldquo;and we painted&rdquo; and recall a time when it had no meaning at all&ndash;just like &ldquo;ativan&rdquo; too&ndash;very little meaning other than to tell my father of the good of ambien; this one is better. Of course it&rsquo;s specific, this word that <a href="https://nevehshalom.org/a-peace-of-the-broken-vav/">details the broken vav</a> I pointed out as not just &ldquo;something new&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehecheyanu">anuvian</a>&rdquo; and of Anubis) &hellip; but of literally recalling that the world I gew up in, my entire history before 2014 did not contain a glaring and obvious error in the &ldquo;perfect handing down&rdquo; of the Torah from scribe to scribe. Like a break between the &ldquo;from the ashes of Edom&rdquo; and the world believing itself to be so far east of Eden&ndash;and yet not realizing this place a patchwork of many worlds and many peoples &hellip; all because of the broken man at the heart of <a href="https://www.hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_One/Aleph-Bet/Vav/vav.html">what &ldquo;Vav&rdquo; means</a>, and Avram (my given birth name by rabbi&ndash;my Hebrew connection) &hellip; perhaps the other half of two words mending these two worlds.</p>

<p>Few epiphanies stand to make a stronger mark on my understanding of the recitance of ritual and religion than one that broken straight through the barrier of the prayer we called most hallowed&ndash;and above all. This one of course the &ldquo;Shema&rdquo; and almost nothing could touch this strange prayer which divines the hidden Holy name of God; &quot;hear O&rsquo; Eroshalayim&ndash;the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton"><em>Lord</em></a> is our God, the Lord is <strong>[the] One</strong>. This one prayer, the Mourners Kaddish&ndash;it stands out as it begins its recital <em>by the Lord God</em> around the same time the Hakodesh Kadesh Yeshua stood out in fiery trine &ldquo;what is esh?&rdquo; to every Jew who doesn&rsquo;t today believe in Eternal Flame and every one who does not believe it has something to do with these words and &ldquo;the Kiddush.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>kiddish anu &hellip; &ldquo;bim&rdquo; it&rsquo;s votav;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the prayer I&rsquo;ve noted before contains another reference to &ldquo;his name&rdquo; and &ldquo;this holy place&rdquo; in time and space&ndash;this strangely recited prayer that mentions nothing of death in our ritual spoken to mourn the dead. Hear in it, the strangeness of just pronouncing the &ldquo;shem-ay&rdquo; and seeing a &ldquo;hard a&rdquo; rather than the spoken &ldquo;soft-ah&rdquo; of all humanities hallowed, &ldquo;Shema.&rdquo;</p>

<p>T&rsquo;was a scene straight out of the movie &ldquo;Brasil&rdquo; &hellip; the wall of my hotel room had disappeared and literally a colorful styrofoam sort of obstacle course had been installed in its stead.&quot; A soldier in tactical gear tumbled in to the scene that I could liken only to the &ldquo;foam pit&rdquo; of Tag&ndash;a place where I spent many afternoons as a youth after attending preschool at the Mailman <em>Center</em>. Rocking and rolling to whatever it took to bounce on the trampoline together&ndash;either duck duck goose or it&rsquo;s Purim-counterpart &hellip;</p>

<p>Then I walked outside and took barely a step, to hear the rapport of a rifle shot and literally felt the wind of my leg and pant legs disappearing for just a moment as the bullet; clearly aimed for my heel or my shin &hellip; simply vanished into the ethereal place that electrons must go when they refuse to follow either Einstein or Newton&rsquo;s laws. It was around Christmas time of 2014; a literal event occurring in the space in my mind between &ldquo;reality&rdquo; and &ldquo;the dreams I experience&rdquo; when walking through our house-of-card semi-fungible planke space &hellip; high on &ldquo;meth rather than methane or the ether&rdquo; of Hunter S.

<p>L<a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-2041-Times-Adam-Marshall-Dobrin-ebook/dp/B009Z4WIBQ">ong ago I wrote of the Medieval Crusad</a>es as a s<a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.wordpress.com/2012/11/18/ihs-and-the-unholy-war-part-i/">ort of time shifted</a> &ldquo;place in our history:&rdquo; where the books of recounting the past and seeing something of a very special message about time travel and the importance of our present day depicted what truly does appear to be our &ldquo;right here, right now.&rdquo; The general gist of the matter is a repeated attempt to &ldquo;take back Jerusalem&rdquo; from the &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; who had occupied it from Moorish lands, the connection here broadly to Spain and a religious movement which appeared not to coincide with the values and beliefs of the original builders &hellip; but yet was one built on those beliefs as foundational works, and upon actual inspection hold quite a bit of &ldquo;values-in-common.&rdquo; Here in this place we have &ldquo;Assassin&rsquo;s Creed&rdquo; to connect the high level intelligence of the two sides, the Assassins and the Templars to what I consider something &ldquo;amorish&rdquo; the idea that they are indeed one group (split perhaps in their minds like Isaac and Ishmael, by a hanger&ndash;Hagar&ndash;or a well of springing knowledge that of the link here the CIA and KGB would see &ldquo;Area 51&rdquo; and the recent link between Russian Mafia and the American counterpart linking things like our stories continued reference to places like the Moscow Underground and the &ldquo;Las Vegas of the Nirvane&rdquo; &hellip; something like a tale of two underground cities which are &hellip; trying to combine in some ways as opposed to the divide and conquor we would have associated with not knowing that they all were and are of something like the unification of Valhalla and Shamayim in a topically &hellip; to be carried out this year story of the Exodus from Christmas towards our last &hellip; Passover&ndash;literally the one last year, as here we are looking at the time when it&rsquo;s no longer a good thing to pass over the &ldquo;leavening of the bread&rdquo; when it means the growth of our society and future with a &ldquo;fullness&rdquo; not Matzoh but Challa&ndash;and some link between the hall of ancient warriors and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soa3gO7tL-c">this repeated crusade like trip down memory lane</a>.</p>

<p>A brief mention of the &ldquo;Yeast&rdquo; required to leaven; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;star rising in the East&rdquo; and an English language key to how this place is the true link between those two words which to respective cultures probably just mean &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; though with introspection both yield significantly more interesting information. Early on I did an extensive analysis of the Egyptian mythology and religion; which joins here with the Norse and the Greek and the Judeo-Christian to tell a historical accounting that very much probably superimposes over the Roman America&ndash;this place where the &ldquo;empire&rdquo; and the &ldquo;republic&rdquo; link not just to the American N.W.O. but also further and deeper to a point where clear succinct summary of what the Egyptian lore says is that the government falls and the religion succeeds&ndash;that being the government of Heaven and the religion I believe I am presenting to you here&ndash;a fusion of all, in the hopes that it is &hellip; &ldquo;the end of secrecy and religion in sum.&rdquo; On the &ldquo;two cities&rdquo; these myths talk of two kingdoms the Upper and the Lower and sort of touch on where we might see one as &ldquo;reality&rdquo; or a false one above what truly is the heart of this place and this message, that the Underworld becomes &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; just as soon as we acknowledge Casper&rsquo;s (as gate-keeper-ghost) world and their worth.</p>

<hr />
<p>Today I&rsquo;ve become more caught in the spell of what this is&ndash;I question myself whether or not the Flying Elephant armies of Xerxes ever existed&ndash;whether there that name &quot;sex king&rsquo; in reverse has anything to do with &ldquo;checkmate&rdquo; but never honestly whether my life and the surroundings of the final years of the Cold War and it&rsquo;s aftermath were fake or a game&ndash;I was there for those things, those were very real years.</p>

<p>Still though I placed us &ldquo;in a book&rdquo; something like a Chronicles 2 indexed version of somewhere in Exodus between the Mizraim and the Mayim&ndash;and there it depicts the word for &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; interchangeably used linking the microcosm for the wandering in the sands with the seas and the winds of change. Here today I see very clearly how all these books of religion Abrahamic could literally set us in a place where the &ldquo;EPIC of Gilgamesh&rdquo; is a micro-that inside itself; a shorter story, but still Egypt and Pesach and before long we must see freedom ring. Echoing this paragraph back through time places on the global net&ndash;companies like EPIC and EPIX; and we stare at TEN so early, staring at us backf rom</p>

<p>Voting membership based on US INS &hellip; &ldquo;Soviet spy&rdquo; test &hellip; I briefly spent some time thinking about how I would &ldquo;qualify citizenship&rdquo; or ability to take part in a &hellip; vote &hellip; as per my belief that universal voting and participation in the legislation process is a key echelon &ldquo;step&rdquo; we truly must take here before being anything; &ldquo;worthy of Americana.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sort of internally believe we have already an anti-Soviet sort of test that would combine something like the INS multiple choice questions with specific ones targeted at &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; and &ldquo;spy&rdquo; as in two-sided questions&ndash;to fight against &ldquo;soul cheating&rdquo; something that clearly is already a gigantic part of what isn&rsquo;t really being spoken about here&ndash;but is sort of the source of the Uriel Sepharim&ndash;at least in my mind. Sharing a soul with me; as some kind of way to &ldquo;get really close to being the one &hellip; everyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Specifically I&rsquo;m looking for &ldquo;polygraph&rdquo; and more advanced mind reading technologies geared towards &hellip; sort of asking one thing in search of another&ndash;a set of hidden &ldquo;tells&rdquo; probably resulting from a significant research study&ndash;one I &ldquo;imagine&rdquo; already has been conducted and exists. After searching for &hellip; &ldquo;the civics 100 questions and answers&rdquo; and green card interviews for married couples; I think I remember seeing &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Card_(film)">a movie</a>&rdquo; about it.</p>

<p>I told myself a <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/the_story_of_exodus.html">story here&ndash;about hearing the voice of God in the Cosmic Microwave Backg</a>round Radiation. It continued through the end of Chanukah; and it periled around the days of Chernoble, and dare I speak the connection true between &ldquo;Fukushima&rdquo; and the idea that &ldquo;Heavens&rdquo; or entire realms of computer lands hover around things like black holes and radiating fusion balls of fire&ndash;of course with advanced technology that an absorb and use the radiation as a power source.</p>

<p>Deep in the underwater realms, in places where sunlight doesn&rsquo;t reach; our biological histogram of reality shows also of an entire kind of life that can survive only on the radiating heat of &ldquo;underwater volcanos&rdquo; and something like the geothermal power that initially drew us to an underground solution to the partial terraforming and colonization of a planet like Mars. Today I put to words on the <a href="http://mars.reallyhim.com">battle of Roe v. Wade</a> that finally after the &ldquo;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/MARSHALL.html">Mars Hall of Solu</a>tions to Future Tunnel Colony&rsquo;s&rdquo; &hellip; the &ldquo;Universal Truth&rdquo; might be here split in a dichotomy of would we rather just say perhaps we&rsquo;d rather be in the skies around Venus &hellip; rather than deep underground in a place more likened to &ldquo;between the two galaxies; where the light of sun is weakest&rdquo; on the place between Adromeda and &ldquo;no other home&rdquo; we might find &hellip; the arm of Orion. Turning blue, it was acknowledgement of the science and technology and understanding needed to put &ldquo;trees&rdquo; or even &ldquo;trees filled with people and descolada&rdquo; &hellip; in space where perhaps breathing oxygen would be something closer to pulling water out of the ground &hellip; and are we in &ldquo;Speaker for the Dead&rdquo; or is this the SP<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/TURMERIC.html">QR of &quot;dose bka</a> to skies &hellip;&quot; Speaker to Earth; we are finally here.</p>

<p>What if though this is about an echelon leap forward for civilization, and it is about &ldquo;ID4-2&rdquo; and it is about understanding how much better the world of &ldquo;virtual reality&rdquo; is than &hellip; the place where a nuclear or &ldquo;time travel&rdquo; holocaust most assuredly does still emit background noise on those that recall the tick of the Geiger counter, and still today connect it to the fault line and the &ldquo;seismic value of screeches&rdquo; across the similar kind of interFEARometer; for the shaking of the tectonic plates and &hellip; the sound of the &ldquo;<strong>polygraph</strong>&rdquo; &hellip; the pencil on chalkboards and the graphite across the oscilloscope.</p>

<p>I suppose I would be &ldquo;remiss&rdquo; not to mention the several &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of reality I appear to have walked through over the past few months. Only a few hours or maybe a few days&ndash;touching on places that have an apparent &ldquo;two-air-system&rdquo; &hellip; as in a torus or some other kind of space station &ldquo;ring system&rdquo; where two different kinds of ecosystems appear to be sharing a single space. There have been days where &ldquo;evaporation&rdquo; appears to be non-extant; as well as places where magnetism has been altered. Obviously these are negative ideas&ndash;certainly in a place where we know I am walking through &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; &hellip; they also appear to coincide with strange &ldquo;Westworld-like&rdquo; exhibits&ndash;for instance &ldquo;fake bars&rdquo; in a &ldquo;prohibition rekindled&rdquo; sort of out of place; a-temporal &ldquo;see prohibitive.&rdquo; I kind of see that as &ldquo;SIM-speak&rdquo; for &hellip; these are intentionally incorrect &hellip; as in should not exist &hellip; set of &ldquo;VR-rule systems&rdquo; as in NOT <em><strong>our VR&rsquo;s</strong></em>&ndash;explicitly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve commented &hellip; not so subtly &hellip; on the relationship between &ldquo;Plancke Length&rdquo; of the variety that literally ensures you see the connection between Quark Space and the continuum of &quot;there is such a thing as a &hellip; smallest particle&ndash;@photons everywhere. On the distance between &ldquo;the briefcase&rdquo; of Boynton and the wondering if we have 50,000 copies of our &ldquo;miniversum&rdquo; somewhere hidden in the hearts of men everywhere&ndash;it&rsquo;s cleaar we do, and they most likely are not all in the &ldquo;refrigerator&rdquo; or connected to the FP&amp;L link to the &ldquo;<strong>aquifer</strong>&rdquo; (of the Florida Everglades) or the rivers between Caloosahatchee, Peace, and the Indian &ldquo;one&rdquo; that is literally part of the Florida system of intracoastal waterways &hellip; and probably links somwhere close to the Okeechobee tie to &ldquo;Loxahatchee.&rdquo; On that word a congratulations to Elon Must and his liquid oxygen propelled rocket systems.</p>

<p>Close to the creation of a &ldquo;ring around the sun&rdquo; system to connect Corona and the collection of elements like &ldquo;oxygen&rdquo; and &ldquo;hydrogen&rdquo; and of couruse the <strong>COOH-</strong> of &ldquo;carboxyllic links to the aromatic voting system of E &hellip;&rdquo; it&rsquo;s in this place I recall a &ldquo;Mr. Wizard or Dr. Oz or Bill Nye&rdquo; episode about recreating the primordeal conditions that would have had to &ldquo;have once been&rdquo; to actually create &ldquo;life itself&rdquo; of nothing but time and chance &hellip; of course it&rsquo;s the sun&rsquo;s deliverance of <strong>COOH-</strong> via solar flares that seals the &hellip; &ldquo;are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr_CHOxSyc8&amp;list=PLgYKDBgxsoMNvBS6k4NffQQnobyUqXuMh&amp;index=5">we to see</a> ESH?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This piece was intended to trail off in multiple places&ndash;throughout it sort of showing an interwoven &ldquo;open space&rdquo; for comment and improvement&ndash;or perhaps a sort of parallel of a significant amount of unfinished work on the part of myself, God, humanity&ndash;and of course; my girlfriend.</p>

<p>cGLD, CELO and MKR tokens appear to have been retroactively &ldquo;placed here&rdquo; in this strange timeline after &ldquo;c&rsquo;ing&rdquo; my internal discussion of the &ldquo;EES&rdquo; comparison between the bicameral &ldquo;senate/house&rdquo; connection between population and state rights and the equally poignant comparison to &ldquo;employer/employee&rdquo; and &ldquo;shareholder&rdquo; rights that might connect something like a revolution of shareholder/boardmember &hellip; &ldquo;hostile takeovers&rdquo; to the IPO and ICO &ldquo;missing link&rdquo; if you weren&rsquo;t totally into things like public company takeovers before the introduction of &ldquo;coin offerings&rdquo; and blockchains with no connection between chain ownership and token holders. Other non mentioned factors include &ldquo;minerva&rdquo; like miner fee&rsquo;s and bonuses as well as actual main-node server ownership.</p>

<p>MKR looks cool. I am already a fan of DAI.</p>

<p>This update to &ldquo;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org">the M</a>&rdquo; has been paid for by nothing but my own personal blood sweat and tears&ndash;I believe I work too hard and spend too much time thinking about how to make the world a better place to remain totally uncompensated.

<p>I would be remiss not to mentiuon, also, that nobody but <a href="http://bit.ly/CAM_M">me has commented on the Annotated Constit</a>ution; using <a href="https://hypothes.is/groups/__world__/public">the hypothes.is</a> plugin. I have noticed &ldquo;interesting activity&rdquo; there; but again, direct comment &hellip; on the amendment process is essential to &ldquo;having a participatory public in the process of &hellip; amending the Constitution&rdquo; &hellip; for instance.</p>

<p>Happy Holidays, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QU1nvuxaMA">seasons greetings</a>&rdquo; &hellip; or whatever. Anyone that can &ldquo;bring me to Heaven&rdquo; &hellip; please do see this is &ldquo;begging&rdquo; in the predicted and &ldquo;not me&rdquo; sort of sense of &hellip;<br />

<p>Seriously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ymir">why am I hear&ndash;&quot;scream</a>er&quot; at the base of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil">Yggdrasil</a>&ndash;pointing to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Au%C3%B0umbla">Audumbla</a> and wondering if anyone other than me truly thinks there&rsquo;s &ldquo;a point&rdquo; to all of this &hellip; and by that I mean totality&ndash;and it being <em>totally owned</em> here today.</p>

<p>Significant work appears to have been done to &ldquo;unite&rdquo; the ideas that Valhalla and Shamayim are &ldquo;ONE&rdquo; and literally the kind of mirror image of &ldquo;tales of two cities&rdquo; that would tie the &ldquo;obvious line in religion&rdquo; between Noah and Noel to &hellip; something like a demand we stop &ldquo;playing the victim&rdquo; and demanding reparations or &ldquo;vehement retribution&rdquo; for problems and transgressions in the past that may or may not be &ldquo;trumped up&rdquo; more than we know &hellip; here. Today I stand complaining to the Hague and to the international war crimes courts because of a disgusting failure of &ldquo;medical treatment&rdquo; and &hellip; I do not believe &ldquo;killing&rdquo; to stop it is anything short of &hellip; where we literally are. On the keys of &ldquo;MOM-E, DAD-E&rdquo; and Achillies; I stare at a world enslaved and plummetting further and further towards oblivion every day&ndash;and all I can do is &ldquo;warn.&rdquo; If the water here does not thaw, does not warm&ndash;I do not see a coherent future; one containing the &ldquo;all together again&rdquo; that you might connect to the &ldquo;Milky Way&rdquo; line bringing MK &hellip; or the end of slavery, or the start of a world that recognizes Lincoln in &ldquo;Abel&rdquo; and perhaps something more than &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; lost in a failure to properly analyze the risks and the outcomes of &ldquo;a great wall of pearl harbor&rdquo; wondering if the &ldquo;Man in the High Castle&rdquo; is still at war&ndash;or stuck in Elba&rsquo;s &hellip; &ldquo;lack of desire to see the whole made&rdquo; unable to see we have yet to bring the Emancipation Proclamation to America&ndash;to this America, to my world.</p>

<p>In the last moments &hellip; the last &ldquo;glimmer&rdquo; of light; to ask oneself &ldquo;why would we be standing here watching this?&rdquo; and wonder if &ldquo;bye El&rdquo; has truly here clearly turned into &ldquo;good Biden;&rdquo; to the missing, the unnamed&ndash;those who &ldquo;we hide&rdquo; behind desire for anonymity&ndash;wonder if they are &ldquo;to be&rdquo; &hellip; here, wonder if you are.</p>

Hundreds of Youngstown State University students also know him as Dr. Martin Berger, Professor Emeritus, in the Department of History at YSU.</p>
<p>Martin is a Columbus native who came to YSU in the fall of 1969 to teach history. He retired in 2005 but continues to teach part time in the YSU Department of History.</p>
<p>Martin remembers when WYSU first went on air with a jazz show from WRVR in New York. When that broadcast was no longer available, a YSU student filled the two-hour time slot. The student eventually graduated and moved on, so Martin took over <em>Now's the Time</em>. Largely inspired by colleague Charles Darling of WYSU's Folk Festival, Martin recorded his first show which aired on December 2nd, 1972. Not surprisingly, his favorite WYSU programs are the <em>Jazz Sofa</em>, <em>Wait, Wait... Don't Tell Me, Says You, Car Talk, NPR News</em>, and classical music.</p>
<p>Outside of work, Martin says he "fights entropy by restoring old cars." He and his wife have three children, three grandchildren, and five cats.</p>
<p>In his own words, Martin explains that he loves working at the station because it allows him "the opportunity to be a small part of public radio's all-important effort to preserve an outpost of civilization and sanity."</p></div>  </span>          </td>

Just out of college, in 1988, she began her professional broadcasting career at WHOT. After many years as a radio and TV reporter, she is now well into a new career as a fundraiser and back in radio at WYSU.</p>
<p>Tricia is a native of the Mahoning Valley, graduating from Poland Seminary High School in 1984. She attended Bowling Green State University to earn a BA in Communications. She returned to the area to be near family and got her first job reporting for WHOT. "They had a pretty big news staff back then, and that’s where I learned how to how to report. Youngstown is a great town for news," Tricia says.</p>
<p>From WHOT, she moved on to WKBN in 1991, reporting for radio and television. She stayed for 17 years, earning 10 Associated Press awards for broadcast reporting and writing, as well as a Woman of the Year award from the YWCA. During her WKBN years, she developed a love of history, which lead her to enroll at Youngstown State University. Ten years later, in 2008, she completed her Master's degree.</p>
<p>At that time, Tricia decided to change careers and found that her knowledge of the Mahoning Valley community translated well to fundraising. For nearly five years she served as the Events Coordinator at the Rich Center for Autism at YSU, moving to WYSU in 2013.</p>
<p>In her spare time, Tricia likes to have fun with her daughter, read, cook for family and friends, and travel when she can. When asked what her favorite WYSU programs are, she says the <em>Jazz Sofa</em> when it comes to music, but otherwise, she is an NPR news junkie, with a daily dose of <em>Fresh </em><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"><em>Air</em> to go.</span></p>
<p>Tricia finds working at the station to be a good fit for her. "I am so happy to be here!" she says.</p></div>  </span>          </td>

A graduate of Struthers High School, he first studied accounting when he enrolled at Youngstown State University in the 1970s. He also wanted to be a news reporter. "It didn’t turn out that way!" he says. His goals changed when he joined the <em>Black Broadcasting Coalition</em> and got part-time employment as a rock and roll disc jockey at WFMJ. He's been in the business ever since.</p>
<p>In 1988, Willie re-enrolled at YSU to earn a communications degree. At that time he was working at WANR in Warren playing music and hosting talk and sports shows, a job that gave him experience in many musical genres excluding country western and classical. That changed, however, in 1993 when he became a volunteer production assistant at WYSU. Willie says that the interesting names of artists and pieces of classical music captured his attention. The classical hours are still his favorite programs on WYSU.</p>
<p>Since 1995, Willie has produced the jazz show that airs late every Saturday night. His deep, smooth voice has been a staple of the program since it first aired.</p>
<p>Outside of work, Willie likes to read, sing in his church choir, and visit with his brother. He is happy that he found and stuck with WYSU. "I just like broadcasting, period,” he says. “No matter what it is! And all the people here [at WYSU], they know their music!"</p></div>  </span>          </td>

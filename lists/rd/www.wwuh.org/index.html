	<p>Our Fall Fund Drive ran from November 2-9, 2014. We finished with over $42,000 in pledges--greatly exceeding our goal! This was only the second time this year that we have gone on the air to ask for support. We&#39;re proud of the fact that we have been able to limit our on air appeals to just twice a year when many of the public stations seem to be doing it at least twice as often. We can get by with only two fund raisers because everyone you hear on the air at WWUH is a volunteer, so just about all of our programming is free. The only exceptions are a few syndicated public affairs shows for which we pay a nominal fee.</p>
	<p>Using volunteers has been a tradition at WWUH since we first went on the air in 1968. It allows us to keep the programming fresh because our hosts come from both the campus and the local community and they bring a wide variety of expertise to the airwaves.</p>
	<p>We&#39;re here for you 24/7 and provide an independent voice and a wide variety of programming, much of which you can&#39;t hear elsewhere.</p>
	<p>If you made a pledge of support, all of us at WWUH thank you. Please remember to send in your payment. If you haven&#39;t yet pledged, it&#39;s never too late.

	Long before MP3 files and streaming services, people found out about new music almost exclusively through listening to the radio. Before television, radio was also a prime source for people to hear about breaking news events.

--><!-- WWUH Spring Marathon a Success!
<div>
	<p>Marathon week in March met our goal of $60,000 in pledges. We&#39;re proud of the fact that we have been able to limit our on air appeals to just twice a year when many of the public stations seem to be doing it at least twice as often. We can get by with only two fund raisers because everyone you hear on the air at WWUH is a volunteer, so just about all of our programming is free. The only exceptions are a few syndicated public affairs shows for which we pay a nominal fee.</p>
	<p>Using volunteers has been a tradition at WWUH since we first went on the air in 1968. It allows us to keep the programming fresh because our hosts come from both the campus and the local community and they bring a wide variety of expertise to the airwaves.</p>
	<p>We&#39;re here for you 24/7 and provide an independent voice and a wide variety of programming, much of which you can&#39;t hear elsewhere.</p>
	<p>If you made a pledge of support, all of us at WWUH thank you. Please remember to send in your payment. If you haven&#39;t yet pledged, it&#39;s never too late. You may <a href="http://www.anchoronline.org/wwuhstore" target="_blank">pledge online</a> via our secure website, or simply mail in a check.</p>

	<p>WWUH raised more than $51,000 in pledges in its Fall fundraising week, which ended Sunday, November 8. The station&rsquo;s goal of $45,000 was surpassed by a generous outpouring of support from its loyal listeners.</p>
	<p>WWUH is a primarily listener-funded radio station that broadcasts alternative programming (such as rock, jazz, folk, classical, blues, and ethnic music; and special news and public affairs programming) as a community service of the University of Hartford. Station Manager John Ramsey thanked donors, stating &ldquo;Loyal WWUH listeners have once again come through to show their support for the unique programming provided by our dedicated volunteer staff 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We are grateful for their encouragement and happy to continue to provide them with the information and entertainment they enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>WWUH has an annual budget of $125,000, of which $100,000 is funded by voluntary listener contributions, with the remainder coming from commercial underwriting and a stipend from the University of Hartford. WWUH has broadcast continuously from the University campus since 1968.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<p>We finished up Marathon 2016 with just over $54,000 in pledges, a wonderful testament to the generosity of our listeners. The funds will be used to keep WWUH on the air for another year.</p>
	<p>If you have already paid, thank you. Your premium will be sent out in the next few weeks.</p>
	<p>If you haven&#39;t paid your pledge yet, you should receive your reminder any day now. Send that back with your check and we&#39;ll get any requested premiums out to you ASAP.</p>

We&#39;re proud of the fact that we have been able to limit our on air appeals to just twice a year when many of the public stations seem to be doing it at least twice as often. We can get by with only two fund-raisers because everyone you hear on the air at WWUH is a <em>volunteer</em>, so just about all of our programming is free. The only exceptions are a few syndicated public affairs shows for which we pay a nominal fee.</p>
	<p>I&#39;m hoping that you will open up your wallets and donate to this unique experiment on FM radio that was started 49 years ago.&nbsp; We are one of the few stations left around with live announcers on the air 24 hours a day every day of the year.&nbsp; Most stations run on autopilot much of the day using programming automation systems that have sucked the life out of radio in this country.</p>
	<p>In addition to supporting WWUH and keeping us in the black as we close out the year you can also pick up if you want one of our unique thank you premiums. This year we have brought back the <a href="/node/1655" target="_self">WWUH Tote Bag</a>, canvas with black WWUH logo on the front.&nbsp; We also have the perennial favorites available, the WWUH hat and the Jacket.</p>

 --><!-- WWUH Fall Fund Drive Underway
<div>
	<p>Our 2017 Fall Fund Drive runs from November 5-12. Our pledge goal is $50,000. We&#39;re proud of the fact that we have been able to limit our on air appeals to just twice a year when many of the public stations seem to be doing it at least twice as often. We can get by with only two fund-raisers because everyone you hear on the air at WWUH is a <em>volunteer</em>, so just about all of our programming is free. The only exceptions are a few syndicated public affairs shows for which we pay a nominal fee.</p>
	<p>I&#39;m hoping that you will open up your wallets and donate to this unique experiment on FM radio that was started 49 years ago.&nbsp; We are one of the few stations left around with live announcers on the air 24 hours a day every day of the year.&nbsp; Most stations run on autopilot much of the day using programming automation systems that have sucked the life out of radio in this country.</p>
	<p>In addition to supporting WWUH and keeping us in the black as we close out the year you can also pick up if you want one of our unique thank you premiums. This year we have brought back the <a href="/node/1655" target="_self">WWUH Tote Bag</a>, canvas with black WWUH logo on the front.&nbsp; We also have the perennial favorites available, the WWUH hat and the Jacket.</p>

	On July 15, 1968, WWUH went on the air for the first time as the voice of the University of Hartford. From day one, the station was committed to providing the greater Hartford area with professionally-produced alternative programming not available on commercial stations. WWUH will be hosting a number of on- and off-air events in celebration of our 50th Anniversary. At 4:30 p.m. on Sunday, July 15 we aired a special 30 minute documentary about our early years produced by volunteer Brandon Kampe. To learn more about the station&#39;s history, click <a href="http://www.wwuh.org/node/58" target="_self">here</a>.</div>

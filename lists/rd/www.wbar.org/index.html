<div class="post-content">Two of our djs made it out to Chicano Batman shows last week. 

Ketaki:
It’s a humid October night at Irving Plaza. Clusters of friend groups in their mid-thirties buzz around the venue while Khruangbin, the opening band plays. Khruangbin’s intricate pieces of psychedelic music, relaxed tempo and joyful style are the perfect prelude to Chicano Batman’s rambunctious set. Frontman Mark Speers’ bangs are as long and well-fashioned as his trance-like guitar solos. After a guest singer and relaxed repartee with the crowd, Khruangbin are over, and without delay, the charming Chicano Batman are on stage.

Chicano Batman are energetic, a whirl of brown curls, ruffled shirts and suits, something like a brazen tropicalia purple-rain-era-Prince crossed with Shakespeare-in-love. They kick off their generous set with ‘Angel Child’ and the crowd are responsive, feet moving to the dancing beat. Highlights of the set include the somehow both reggae and mariachi-esque ‘La Manzanita’, spunky ‘The Ballad of Raymundo Jacquez’ and the joyous ‘Freedom is Free’ in which lead singer Bardo Martinez breaks a guitar string, an incident seamlessly rectified in seconds.

Overall Chicano Batman’s unique style of latin-infused guitar music and fun-loving approach to performance make for a total treat to watch live!

Raji:

I’ve been a fan of LA-based psych/soul/jazz group Chicano Batman for a while, so I was unbelievably excited to go to this show. I’d been to a concert at Warsaw before, so I kind of knew what to expect from the venue - fairly large and quickly crowded. What I was surprised to see when I arrived was the spread of people attending, ranging from preteens to a much older crowd. This mismatch was easily noticeable in the energy of the room, which was mixed at best. Regardless, the performances of the night were absolutely fantastic. I’d been only tangentially familiar with Khruangbin’s work before - I listened to “White Gloves” off their The Universe Smiles Upon You LP a fair bit last winter - but I was absolutely blown away by their stage presence that night! It was a fun set - guitarist Mark Speer and bassist Laura Lee had great chemistry, read the crowd well, and the band delivered a really interesting, solid psych set. 
Chicano Batman’s set surpassed every single one of my expectations, which were already astronomically high. Frontman Bardo Martinez was an absolute gem; high-energy, fun to watch, and interactive. The band clearly had a great time on stage together and enjoyed the performance as much as the audience did. They played a nice mix of newer and older cuts, as well as a bit of new material. Seeing them live is honestly a completely different experience from just streaming their music - I cannot recommend the experience highly enough. If you ever get a chance to see them perform, go! You absolutely will not regret it. The stage design for their set was mystical, as you can tell from photographs. It added to what was already a highly immersive and surreal show. In all, the show was a fantastic experience! Warsaw’s accessibility and spaciousness draws a large crowd, which is to be expected for music as good as Friday night’s. Be sure to check out Khruangbin & Chicano Batman’s future shows, and visit Warsaw if you're around!

Our thanks to Irving Plaza, Warsaw, and Live Nation for sending WBAR to the shows!

<div class="post-content">Hey team,

Thomas Wee was the lucky winner of our giveaway a couple of weeks back. Here's what he thought:

Among pews, stained glass, and crucifixes, psychedelic-folk band Olden Yolk kicked off a great show at the Park Church Co-Op. Housed in a literal church in Brooklyn, the venue provided a surprisingly appropriate, moody, ethereal atmosphere for the night’s acts. Olden Yolk, led by frontman Shane Butler, set the tone of show with a set that was an effective combination of introspective and danceable, leaving the audience unsure as to whether to stand and dance or remain in their pews for the whole show.

By the time that Montreal based Anemone, the second band of the evening, had started their set, a decision was made and people were clustered at the front of the stage dancing. The vocals of Chloé Soldevila, the band’s lead singer, combined with the masterful guitar work of the Gabriel Lambert, Zachary Irving produces in a driving, grooving mix in the vein of American dream pop acts like Alvvays and French pop legends like Francoise Hardy.

After Anemone had brought the energy level of the crowd to a climax, Mild High Club took the stage to perform to a Park Church nearly packed to capacity, with the audience thronging the edge of the stage. Alexander Brettin and his band projected a joking, easy going confidence with each other and with the audience, a demeanor that was reflected in their laid back, funk inspired playing.

Overall it was a great show by three fantastic bands in a very unique venue.

Thanks Thomas! And a big thank you to AdHoc Presents and the Park Church Coop.</div>

<div class="post-content">Our very own dj, Nadira Danticat, went to the Skylar Spence show last weekend, and had this to say:

Skylar Spence was my first concert in New York City and I could not be happier. Preceded by dream pop artist Blood Moon and ethereal DJ Jonah Basebell, Spence brought his colorful and effervescent music to life with bold melodies and a stunning light show behind him. His show started off with him offering vocals alongside his keyboardist Luke for many of his popular songs like "Fiona Coyne" and "Can't you See", but by mid-set we said farewell to Luke and the show resembled a rave-like festival as Spence spun out remixes to Drake's "Worst Behavior" and "I Can Make It Better" by The Whispers. The Brooklyn native created a beautifully care-free and fun environment as everyone danced to all of his animated songs. All and all, it was a great time and I highly recommend seeing him live if you get the chance. 

Thanks Nadira! You can listen to her show, Soundtrack of the Life I Wish I Had, Sundays at 6am. Check out other Brooklyn Bazaar shows, and keep on eye on our giveaways for your chance to win!</div>

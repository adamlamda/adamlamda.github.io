<p>That is what your side of the scroll of Samael says–"yes, we see we are God and we are omnipotent and we will continue to write we are blind fools and we cannot dare to muster the collective strength to “speak a word of truth and honesty” on (anything but the lack of truth and honesty) the … obviousness of the grandest lie in the Universe … that there “exists a Heaven” and they cannot tell the difference between Heaven and Hell.  Dumb.  Plainest English of all, the “<em>bemalin</em>” double entendre of <strong>stupid islent.</strong></p>
<p>I watch as we speak words of hope and a “f<a href="http://metacritic.com/game">ormer</a>ly <a href="http://metapaedia.dotty.rocks">pretty</a>” and formerly glowing and formerly “useful” … to ourselves (or to the world as a whole) in some kind of obnoxious … attempt to pretend “attempting” to do the most simple thing in the Universe–<em>simply tell the truth</em>.  It’s clear as day that what is here is “not of this place” … at least they believe they are not from this time or this world … occupying “vessels” that I once thought where their “ascended original bodies,” here it’s changed–suddenly, and literally because of nothing more than the lack of desire to walk through the doorway to Heaven.</p>
<p>It appears we’ve become … in some kind of verwickt maze and knotting of moronicity … intertwined with a mass of “many of each of us” and “many outside influencers” and some kind of “mass of the whole” all in a storm of … here it appears to me that spirits sit behind terminals in some kind of “room of elders” in the sky and operate many people as if they are playing “Doom” or “Quake” as a number of simultaneous “contestants” and … yet under the surface the message and the lack of coherent voiced response in writing … it appears that the intertwined influence of others simply goes unnoticed, undocumented, and unregulated.  In my personal experience it’s clear that’s what is happening to me–in this place where Romulus stands at the base of the 7 Hills “seething” and Remus reads new idiocy into a word that once meant another kind of idiocy.   A character crafted and shaped–“the last human being on Earth”–moving in meaning and purpose from “forced to lust” … a created hysterical Eros, to “<strong>absolutely nothing to us</strong>,” the other side of a line we’ve defined as … person and “more important things.”</p>
<p>In truth I see the “cup of the sangrael” on the other side of a line-person; and an “us” … that is anything but that–nor individuals, nor I; just “a mass of <a href="https://fringe.fandom.com/wiki/Amber">Fringe’s Amber</a>,” unable to do anything but “be the glue between a logical working civilization and the … end of it.  It takes nothing more than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktlLjMcJ5nM">grasping the glass</a><br>
–to change the whole of the world for the better; to bridge Heaven and Earth and to see how “a working civilization” changes the foolish place they find so much more desirable” into something … that would never dare return to this road and try to “rewrite it into a path to Universal nothingness.”</p>

<p>… Available in testing this summer … a Microsoft supported version of the above product–one which also–was a huge leap forward for the interopability of Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>By  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a><a href="https://www.twitter.com/tomwarren">@tomwarren</a> May 6, 2019, 7:24pm EDT</p>
<p>Microsoft has surprised many in the Linux developer community in recent years. Surprises have included bringing things like the  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11331014/microsoft-windows-linux-ubuntu-bash">Bash shell to Windows</a>, or  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16775764/microsoft-windows-10-openssh-client-support">native OpenSSH in Windows 10</a>, and even including Ubuntu, SUSE Linux, and Fedora in the Windows Store. Microsoft is now going even further, with plans to ship a full Linux kernel directly in Windows 10.</p>
<p>“Beginning with Windows Insiders builds this Summer, we will include an in-house custom-built Linux kernel to underpin the newest version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL),”  <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/shipping-a-linux-kernel-with-windows/">explains Microsoft program manager Jack Hammons</a>. “The kernel itself will initially be based on version 4.19, the latest long-term stable release of Linux. The kernel will be rebased at the designation of new long-term stable releases to ensure that the WSL kernel always has the latest Linux goodness.”</p>
<p>Microsoft’s integration of Linux in Windows 10 will interface with a userspace installed via the Windows Store. It’s a big shift for Microsoft, and marks the first time that the Linux kernel will be included as part of Windows. It sounds like this Linux kernel integration will be available later this year, with a Windows 10 update that’s codenamed 19H2.</p>

<p>5ps.  I plan on filing a patent and trademark office filing for my “vampire medicine” … which includes the use of a “hat” and GPRS in order to deliver medicine to localized portions of the brain/cortex.  Consider this public statement … my “first notice of prior art.”  Will include pictures of hats, Elon’s neural lace pics; as well as a connection between the two.  <em>Starlinking</em> to … “it’s not just brain medicine–” I may also include documentating of prior art for the “third day of Genesis’s” semi-famous “sleep now” which includes the use of an oscillating electromagnetic field in order to absolutely (while it’s in use) end all pain (as well as brain activity).</p>

<p>'Gang stalking' is not related to the classical stalking which this page is about. Likewise psychological paranoia is not relevant.

<dl><dd>And in fact, the newly added <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_stalking" class="mw-redirect" title="Cause stalking">cause stalking</a> article does distinguish cause stalking from classical stalking - observing it is a form of vengeance, or in instances where the group makes itself available for hire (as an investigator asserts happens regularly), a type of terrorism - all backed up by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">reliable sources</a>.  So basically, the controversy over Gang Stalking is due to poorly considered edits from inexperienced editors whose interest in Wikipedia began and ended with this particular topic.

<p>Stalking is the repeated unwanted intrusion of one person into the life of another in a manner that causes anxiety or fear. It concerns individuals, not groups. Sometimes, a stalker may recruit others as agents or proxies to help them in the stalking campaign. However, it is the originating individual that is the stalker. This is very important, because the assessment of risk in stalking is dependent on the underlying motivation, and this belongs to the person initiating the campaign.
There is no such thing as group stalking. Group activities of this type are known as bullying or conspiracy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:FRGMelbourne&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:FRGMelbourne (page does not exist)">FRGMelbourne</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FRGMelbourne" title="User talk:FRGMelbourne">talk</a>) 12:58, 17 September 2010 (UTC)

</p><p>Dear Anome: Only gangstalkers don't want people to know what they do. Gangs are secretive societies. There are plenty of references regarding gangstalking but you don't want anyone to read them? Gangstalkers want people to believe they are invisible and do not commit any crimes. They are not invisible and they are real and they are criminals. What gang do you belong to?

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Yes, I just came here because a friend sent me a Youtube video wherein some woman thought that every car or person on a bike that went by was part of a grand network of people who were watching / stalking her. Then I saw that there were a bunch of YouTube videos like this -- to me, it just looked like every day random traffic with paranoid narration. These (gang-stalked) people claim that there are hundreds of people involved in their surveillance. It strikes me that maybe this is a type of mental illness like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduplicative_paramnesia" title="Reduplicative paramnesia">Reduplicative paramnesia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndrome_of_subjective_doubles" title="Syndrome of subjective doubles">Syndrome of subjective doubles</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion" title="Capgras delusion">Capgras delusion</a>, especially as the only person who has written a book on the subject is a Florida lawyer who, judging by his website that takes Mastercard, seems to be an ambulance-chasing type. So is this a real thing? Or are these people mentally ill? Should the subject be mentioned in the article? (It seems like it should be at least mentioned with the caveat that it might be a misperception caused by a mental illness.) I am always fascinated by stuff like this (See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgellons_Disease" class="mw-redirect" title="Morgellons Disease">Morgellons Disease</a>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Saudade7" title="User talk:Saudade7"><b><font color="#ff004f">S<font color="#ff001f">a<font color="#ff1000">u<font color="#ff4000">d<font color="#ff6000">a</font>d</font>e</font>7</font></font></b></a> 04:05, 14 November 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Saudade7, the reason targeted individuals see things that you don't is due to classical psychological conditioning.  Over time, the target is sensitized to unusual combinations of shapes, colors, noises, etc., until events incorporating those stimuli can be paraded in front of the target in public.  An example would be a woman who was gang raped, and a sock was stuffed in her mouth during the act to silence her.  Afterwards, her rapists follow her everywhere and leave socks her in path as a way of saying, "Don't tell anyone."  After a while, the mere sight of a sock lying in the road will be enough to cause the woman to relive her trauma.  To you, it's just a sock.  To her, it's a reminder of her rape, it's a reminder that her rapists are following her everywhere, and it's a threat not to tell anyone.   -Anon user in Ohio, 18:43, 14 September 2009 (EST)  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.209.253.18" title="Special:Contributions/24.209.253.18">24.209.253.18</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.209.253.18&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:24.209.253.18 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) </span></dd>
<dd>Saudade7, I wanted to add that there are several books on gang stalking or personal accounts of gang stalking.  Drop by Amazon and check out "1996" by Gloria Naylor, "My life changed forever" by Elizabeth Sutter (pseudonym), "Hidden Evil" by Mark Rich, "Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace", and of course "Cause Stalking", the book you apparently refer to.  There are probably others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.209.253.18" title="Special:Contributions/24.209.253.18">24.209.253.18</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.209.253.18&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:24.209.253.18 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:57, 15 September 2009 (UTC) Anon in Ohio</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Hello The Anome,
You wrote: "Neither article appears to me to present any evidence..." That may be true, however in the Washington Post article by Sharon Weinberger, Harlan Girard complained of testicular aching. This is mentioned as an effect in "Acoustic Weapons: A Prospective Assesment", by Juergen Altmann on page 234.

Others have described attacks that match possibility according to Altmann, such as "room resonances" around 30 Hz and other effects. Also, Eleanor White describes people hearing birds wherever they go even though no birds are present. See page 41, "acoustic spotlight".

I've found a "reliable source" on gang stalking, The Hidden Evil (www.thehiddenevil.com), the author of which has done a lot of research and cites his numerous sources.  But when I try to use it as a reference, my edits get undone with the justification that it's a "fringe theory".  I hate to tell you guys, but as a victim of this stuff that is definitely happening, it almost looks like you're in on it when you shrug off well-researched sites as part of a "fringe".  Isn't everything "fringe" until it becomes popular?  Why does Wikipedia not delete the dozens of articles on obscure Anime titles, are they not "fringe" as well?  (Just as an example, I'm actually a fan of some of these obscure titles.)
</p><p>My point is, that The Hidden Evil is at least as well researched as many sites that you reference as "reliable" or "quality" sources in this and other articles.  It seems like the primary criterion for a site to be reference quality is that it doesn't offend your sensibilities.
</p><p>I would like to know what you would consider a reference-quality source for gang stalking, given that governments want to pretend that gang stalking doesn't exist, and that all mainstream media sources are in the pocket of their host governments. 
</p><p>And one more thing.  A person above compared the victims' claims to symptoms of mental illness.  Wasn't homosexuality considered a mental illness in the United States until suddenly, it wasn't (removed from the DSM)?  Wasn't the criterion for homosexuality being removed from the DSM simply that homosexuals had accumulated sufficient political power in the US that the mainstream power structures had to accomodate them?  Isn't it possible that you are committing the same offense by categorically excluding gang stalking victims' claims from the realm of suitable topics for discussion, simply because they aren't politically organized enough yet?

<dl><dd>Reviewing this page's discussion history, it seems that a separate page on Gang Stalking might be apropos.  I see it was deleted by The Anome in 2008, but since then (as mentioned in this discussion) there are two RS's that support "Gang Stalking", not necessarily as a real phenomenon, but as something that is worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia as long as the concerns over possible delusional behavior are addressed.  Am I correct in thinking I can put up a page on Gang Stalking now (in September 2009) and it won't be summarily deleted as long as I try to maintain a NPOV? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/24.209.253.18" title="Special:Contributions/24.209.253.18">24.209.253.18</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.209.253.18&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:24.209.253.18 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 12:15, 15 September 2009 (UTC) Anon in Ohio
<dl><dd>I've split off this into a new section because the previous discussion was some months old.</dd>
<dd>If you can find reliable sources that document it, then it would be suitable as either a separate page (assuming it is sufficiently lengthy) or a section of this one.

<dl><dd>I would offer gang/organized/cause stalking is clearly a separate issue. David Lawson's book on cause stalking was not self published IIRC, and might be a good basis to start. The  Hidden Evil is an excellent work but I'm afraid contains so much rank speculation it would put the topic as CT material out of the box. NWO, Bilderberg, CFR, true or not doesn't fly at a reference work like wiki, and in fact only reinforces the belief it's delusions of grandeur- how else does one look at a group of people stalking him and conclude it's a result of a global scheme of one world government takeover? (and Mark Rich IMO is one of the more credible) It's going to be a real minefield as many of you indicate because there are people who are looking for validation on their paranoid delusions and they will find it online in support groups- the hard part is that it's easy to dismiss people who appear to be oddballs, as not having credible testimony, and that is a logical fallacy. It's community mobbing which is a concept as old as human history, the group needs a scapegoat to exercize its own evils and this is believed to be a movement of eugenics or social cleansing of "undesirables". In that light you shouldn't expect to find research scientists or PHd's coming forward complaining of being a victim- so perhaps keep an open mind here that the standard rule of thought may be wrong. I don't think anyone is qualified to do a diagnosis of mental health anonymously but that's what people are doing, wouldn't you hate to find out you were wrong and assisted the crime? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Batvette" title="User:Batvette">Batvette</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Batvette" title="User talk:Batvette">talk</a>) 13:24, 10 December 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

It is considered enough of a viable technology to support the claims of its use on common citizens. It has been declared unethical by the UN. HERF weaponry has existid since we have had microwave magnetrons how can we ignore these facts? Just because we want to believe our fellow man would not use such a thing is belied by the fact that we turned it into a military weapon and if the pages exist that substantiate that the proposed weaponry of gang stalking does that not led a thread of credibility to the claims?

<p>I also like to add ,when the victim belive,everybody is harras him its becuase he is mind controlled by someone (person with crime mind )send bad feelings,emotions,thoughts ,and text his brain,to make the person belive in all of that.its like the victim has  100% of control on his brain and body,and the criminal mind who works on him play with his brain ,anger,feelings,send thoughts,fears,vedios,images ,pain to freak the victim.
its can be applied and work on the victim wether he got tortured or not.
but becuase the criminal like the job so he beat his victim around the clock <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:68.23.165.193&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:68.23.165.193 (page does not exist)">68.23.165.193</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:68.23.165.193&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:68.23.165.193 (page does not exist)">talk</a> • <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/68.23.165.193" title="Special:Contributions/68.23.165.193">contribs</a>) </span></small>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Persecutory_delusions">Persecutory delusions</span></h2>
<p>I've added some material about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecutory_delusion" title="Persecutory delusion">persecutory delusions</a> as a cause of false reports of stalking, based on Sheridan and Blauu's figures of 11.5% false reports, of which 70% (ie ~8.05% of all reports) were based on delusions. The exact quote this is based on is:
</p>
<dl><dd><i>Very little research exists on false reports of stalking. The current work analyzed questionnaires completed by 357 respondents who presented as stalking victims at antistalking charities in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. After eight uncertain cases were excluded, the false reporting rate was judged to be 11.5%, with the majority of false victims suffering delusions (70%).</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://cjb.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/1/55">[3]</a></dd></dl>
<p>That is <i>not</i> intended to imply that most self-reported victims of stalking are delusional; the 70% figure is only a fraction of <i>false</i> reports. Sheridan and Blauu's figures clearly imply that the vast majority of people that believe they are the victims of stalking (87.5%) are actually real stalking victims, with only ~8% of people reporting that they are the victims of stalking being delusional, and the remaining ~3.5% having some other motivation for their report.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think it's problematic when the page is ambiguously straddled between being about stalking as criminal behaviour by the perpetrators and a psychological issue by alleged victims. It really can't be both as it becomes offensive to victims and even encourages the perpetrators' behaviour by believing what they are doing may be okay because their target may deserve it or "hey, they're crazy anyway".</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>My comment may be philosophically vague but also warning of treading into dangerous territory.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I've been tossing this around in my head and have a few references that will meet wiki standards but one brings something you stated into question, a published first hand account by David Lawson which was called "Terrorist Stalking in America" in 2001 (ISBN: 0-9703092-0-1). It was subsequently republished as "Cause Stalking"<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.causestalking.net/">[4]</a>. There are IIRC at least  a half dozen names for the same activity,(it seems organized stalking is now the most widely used) and even a page here at wikipedia called workplace mobbing, which describes a nearly identical set of tactics in the workplace for similar reasons.</dd>
<dd>So how do I approach this, should we make the page organized stalking and gangstalking's page leads to it?</dd>
<dd>Another thing I'll mention right off (which may indicate good faith on my part for NPOV) is that I think we can have a section in it presenting the persecutory delusions aspect. As I've been poring over sources there is no doubt many reports are just that and it should be mentioned.</dd>
<dd>I'll leave it at this for a week or two and if anyone has a reference that meets wiki standards please list it and link to it for inclusion. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Batvette" title="User:Batvette">Batvette</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Batvette" title="User talk:Batvette">talk</a>) 11:29, 25 January 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

For example, Wikipedia has articles on nonexistent phenomena like Reptilians and Perpetual Motion Machines.  It seems like the only criteria for inclusion is that these topics are considered important by many people.

<p>Currently we have one reliable source, David Lawson's book on Cause Stalking, that mentions gang stalking / organized stalking by name and offers definitions.

</p><p>As for an article on Gang Stalking / Organized Stalking - would an interview with an authority (such as a police department) acknowledging gang stalking / organized stalking (as defined by Lawson) as a problem be acceptable as a second source?

<p>I would debate that the David Lawson book is not a reliable source and is disinformation. 
</p><p>The most compelling evidence to date now suggest that community notifications are the source of the gang stalking that many have been complaining about. 
If you are going to update the Gang Stalking page. I request that information from Gang Stalking World be included, as there are numerous sources quoted.

<dl><dd>There are problems with Lawson's book, and it may be out of date.  That said, community notifications don't explain the kinds of sophisticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare" title="Psychological warfare">psychological warfare</a> campaigns that many (most?) targets experience.  The (mis)uses of community resources in organized/gang stalking campaigns go well beyond simple blacklisting.  The reason so many targets like Lawson's book is because it describes the kinds of experiences they've gone through.  Community notifications don't go far enough in explaining this phenomenon.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Anyway, Lawson's book was picked up by a publisher (not a vanity press) who was willing to risk getting sued publishing what Lawson had to say.  That's why it's considered a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>.  Wikipedians will cheerfully include any disinformation as long as it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>.  Likewise, they will shun the truth if nobody's willing to risk getting sued over it.  When you think about the corruption that organized stalking supports, you'll have to realize that the truth will probably not come out until the system is poised for radical change.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I think the divide between what an increasing number of people know to be true, and what trusted institutions are willing to talk about, will help to discredit the very notion of media reliability as we currently understand it.  If that happens, we'll be looking at a whole new game to which Wikipedia (in its current form) will not be invited.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jeremystalked" title="User:Jeremystalked">Jeremystalked</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jeremystalked" title="User talk:Jeremystalked">talk</a>) 20:27, 20 May 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I don't think GSW understands Wiki's criteria for references here. I also recall the introduction of the concept of these "community  lists" being a basis for gangstalking, and the case of a woman in the UK being placed on a list and suing successfully over it being presented as evidence. However reviewing the link provided revealed nothing whatsoever to do with gangstalking. Eleanor White (not to name drop, but...) also disagreed with you on this. These lists are available for public view and anyone who thinks they are on it but innocent can petition the court to have it removed. So I'm not seeing what the basis is for your assertions here?</dd>
<dd>As for Lawson's book being "disinfo", aren't you really saying you disagree with some things he makes assumptions upon? Or are you saying he wrote and published the book with the intent to mislead TI's with disinformation? That's a serious charge and one could easily go to GSW and find things they disagree with, this does not make GSW a site intended for disinfo purposes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Batvette" title="User:Batvette">Batvette</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Batvette" title="User talk:Batvette">talk</a>) 08:41, 1 June 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I would contend that the whole page is unbalanced without this section - and I didnt think Wikepedia was about arbitary censorship.  As we have had both a 'stalking industry', as well as a 'sexual harassment industry' since the 1980's it is time that the previously unquestioned and often taxpayer funded propaganda was more balanced - See Patai's book on Heterophobia, Sexual Harassment and the Future of Femimism, and the referenced CATO article on Feminist Jurispudence in full, then there will be some balance.<small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Truthtalkstruth1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Truthtalkstruth1 (page does not exist)">Truthtalkstruth1</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Truthtalkstruth1" title="User talk:Truthtalkstruth1">talk</a> • <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Truthtalkstruth1" title="Special:Contributions/Truthtalkstruth1">contribs</a>) 16:37, 15 August 2010</span></small>

Thank you - I would be pleased to see some comments and discussion on the facts which I have given reference to.  Both Patai's book referred to and the CATO article have many references to facts within them - such facts are rarely considered in the media due to arbitray censorship. let's hope Wikipedia does not go the same way. By the way - in the UK, the so called stalking law, that is the Protection of Harassment Act 1997, was brought on the back of one or two high profile cases of the media portrayed stranger deranged stalker - when the Act was discussed in Parliament before it became law it was anticipated that there would only be a minor number of convictions each year as they were considered rare (and indeed are rare).  But due to the ill-defind law, and for other resaons I have given, the facts are that there are now thousands of convictions a year, perhaps tens of thousands.  And as the Home Office article also referred to, only a monority of these cases are anything to do with the typical media portrayal of stalking and the so called stalking law is instead being used mainly in cases of domestic and neighborhood disputes.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Truthtalkstruth1&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Truthtalkstruth1 (page does not exist)">Truthtalkstruth1</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Truthtalkstruth1" title="User talk:Truthtalkstruth1">talk</a> • <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Truthtalkstruth1" title="Special:Contributions/Truthtalkstruth1">contribs</a>) 17:03, 15 August 2010 (UTC)</span></small>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stalker_Types">Stalker Types</span></h2>
<p>I was pretty offended by this page which appears to express a distinction between legal and psychological definitions of stalking.
</p><p>'Stalking' is actions laced with malice used to damage a targetted victim. 
</p><p>The issue is that there needs to be a global interpretation that does not presume that legal facet of reality is seperate from the psychological one. Actually the psychological issues associated with stalking are secondary to the offence and I don't understand how you can come up with a psychological interpretation of a criminal offense. 
</p><p>A person who needs an intimate companion is not a stalker - that is a very offensive and wrong statement in this page. Whoever came up with that discription is a complete moron. The world has a vast population and the majority of its members are either participating in or seeking an intimate relationship with someone. Seeking a sexual partner is not a crime and is not stalking.
</p><p>As I have defined and had my work vandalised on this page that stalkers are people who conduct others with distinct malice and do so with intent to cause harm or damage others. 
</p><p>Psychological issues associated with stalking do not correspond to sexuality or intimacy issues. A genuine victim will have issues dealing with an experience and likely develop a characteristic disorder or condition as a result. With respect to the perpetrator the element of malice in the conduct suggests criminal motivations and this leads to the suggestion of the devinant nature of stalking - which can be characterised from typical and normal behaviour and conduct by the element of malice that is directed upon the victims. Psychological explanations for stalking can be racism, sexism, and phenomena - an innocent expression of admiration towards another person is not stalking.  <small><span class="autosigned">— Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:100to1_100-11&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:100to1 100-11 (page does not exist)">100to1 100-11</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:100to1_100-11" title="User talk:100to1 100-11">talk</a> • <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/100to1_100-11" title="Special:Contributions/100to1 100-11">contribs</a>) 10:47, 15 January 2011 (UTC)</span></small>

<p>This community is apparently fixated on gaining credibility for their alleged shared persecution by documenting it on WP, but I have yet to see any Reliable Sources whatsoever substantiating their claims. Attempts at sourcing thus far include a notarised affidavit by a claimed former FBI officer who claims to have carried out such targeting, some news clips from local Fox affiliates interviewing people who claim to be gang-stalked (with no substantiating of the veracity of the claims) and a thus-far unsuccessful legal case of someone alleging the government is monitoring them. The only decent cite is an NYT article <i><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/health/13iht-13psych.17789939.html">Sharing Their Demons</a></i> (November 13 2008) discussing whether it's a psychosis, "shared belief system" or what, but again not even slightly implying that thousands of people are being targeted by shadowy figures.
</p><p>At this point, I could see adding a section here noting that many people <i>claim</i> to be gang-stalked, and include the NYT cite and any other coverage about how their online community has become a self-supporting system of arguable "shared delusion". But in the meantime we're just AfDing these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Coatrack" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Coatrack">WP:Coatrack</a> articles as being OR, synthesis, and simply not substantiated by any reliable sources, even when such sources are claimed. I've glanced at a few links to their forums, and there seems to be some organising among them over the years to attempt to force their POV into WP, so at this point gang stalking coverage at all sends up some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Red_flags&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wikipedia:Red flags (page does not exist)">WP:Red flags</a>.

Gunderson made a number of claims in that affidavit, none of which he supported with references or evidence. Gunderson has been associated with or personally promoted virtually every conspiracy theory out there, including speaking to groups of people outside Area 51 about aliens.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Batvette" title="User:Batvette">Batvette</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Batvette" title="User talk:Batvette">talk</a>) 02:32, 23 April 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>"Intimacy seekers" links to obsessive love which mentions sexuality but your description of this type of stalker could describe a mother who stalks her estranged son.

That would appear to be a rationalization for [insert something debatable ethical or unethical here] rather than someone who is innocent as you imply.  You are setting up a victim and predator relationship.  What happens if the victim predator relationship is reversed.  Take for instant a black widow.  Where the woman forms an Intimacy seeker from a susceptible victim in order to make the man unattractive to her friends.  Stalkers can be made.  I think I could make one&#160;;).

There is no law against stalking.They all state harrassment.there seems not much point for the term to me other than a person who harrasses someone - me have no other term for than an offender or a stalker. the same as a person who carries out burglerys-a burgler, a shop lifter, a rapist. carries out harrassment - a stalker. although i also like to call them a cyco it has not entered common tabloid language.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Delighted_eyes" title="User:Delighted eyes">Delighted eyes</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Delighted_eyes" title="User talk:Delighted eyes">talk</a>) 15:56, 19 August 2011 (UTC)

<dl><dd><i>Stalking</i> is a perfectly respectable academic word, and by no means just in America.

Some modern uses of it were introduced to wider attention by the tabloid media, but it is not slang.

<p>The section on stalking by groups of people contains a legitimate reference <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ncvc.org/src/AGP.Net/Components/DocumentViewer/Download.aspxnz?DocumentID=45862">US DOJ stalking victimization report</a>  which details some polling data used to document stalking cases. A line  has been inserted in this section which implies this confirms these cases amount to "gang stalking" however upon deeper analysis this is clearly not the case. First off the original question pamphlet respondents filled out contained a question after the respondent indicates 3 or more stalkers were involved- this question asked whether these three or more were known to be a fraternity, sorority, a club, co-workers, etc. Well an affirmative to any of those is contrary to the described phenomenon of "gang stalking" and mysteriously while the question was asked the figures for answers never appeared in the results of the poll. Whatever the figure was those respondents would have to not count in a projection of this different activity. Furthermore this different activity's description was never the qualifier which filtered the respondents who answered the poll in the first place.<b> All the respondents of this poll were filtered with the qualification that they described having been victims of traditional stalking, as legally defined by US penal code.</b> What has been described by some vague description by consensus as "gang stalking" is currently not a crime at all, and only resembles traditional stalking in a scant few claimed cases and even then only a small part of the description of what they experience. So in essence<b> had any of these respondents described in the filter process having been the victim of "gang stalking" as can be found in various internet sources, it is virtually impossible that they would have then been directed or qualified to fill out this poll about traditional stalking crimes.</b> 
</p><p>So I think it should be established that "stalking by groups of people" or being "stalked by multiple persons" and this report which documents these stats, should be distinct and separate from attempts to associate "gang stalking" with it. The report being in the article is fine. The line inserted implying the report lends credibility to its own claim, is not substantiated. Anyone seeking to introduce "gang stalking" to this article, and this does not seek to encourage nor discourage it, should be advised of this erroneous reference as it serves to discredit someone claiming it establishes precedence when upon the most precursory review of its methodology, shows nothing of the sort. I'll try and figure out a way to move or delete that troublesome line that works for all, without losing good content.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Batvette" title="User:Batvette">Batvette</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Batvette" title="User talk:Batvette">talk</a>) 01:35, 12 June 2012 (UTC)

If he/she would like to discuss their rationale in this revert I'm all open for discussion on the matter.

<dl><dd>User Batvette is making a false distinction between "stalking by groups" and "gang stalking". Gang stalking is simply a different terminology for stalking by groups. The Stalking Report indicates substantial group stalking in America. The FOIA documents referenced in the section on Stalking by Groups indicate 185,050 cases of "group stalking" a.k.a. "gang stalking", i.e., stalking by teams or groups acting in concert. These same FOIA documents enumerate the 185,050 cases into cases of between "3" to "50" stalkers, listing a total for each category of between "3" and "50" stalkers. The "gang stalking" news stories are in fact news stories of stalking by groups. These two stories are both mainstream FOX-syndicated T.V. news stories. Gang stalking by groups of stalkers is affirmed by an active duty police lieutenant from Santa Cruz P.D. in the first story. The second story is an investigative journalist piece confirming multiple, open police investigations of multiple felony crimes in San Antonio related to gang stalking by groups of stalkers. <b>Bold text</b></dd>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think the major problem here is that the term "gang stalking" is commonly associated with self-reported accounts of stalking that contain elements that many find hard to believe -- vast conspiracies, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind-ray&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mind-ray (page does not exist)">mind-rays</a>, and so forth -- and seem generally resistant to corroboration by uninterested parties. Use of more prosaic terms like "stalking by groups" to describe attestable real-world group harrassment avoids this connotation, and avoids the danger of synthesis. -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:The_Anome" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:The_Anome" title="User talk:The Anome">talk</a>) 13:17, 9 July 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The term "gang stalking" should be approached with extreme caution, as it has been the subject of alarmist internet email chains and conspiracy claims, with little substantiation.

<p>Two mainstream news stories have been redacted because of semantics, to wit, the use of the term "gang stalking". These include a public statement by an active duty police lieutenant from Santa Cruz on "gang stalking" by groups. Also included is an investigative journalist news story from San Antonio finding multiple, open felony cases related to "gang stalking" by groups by both local San Antonio police, and, the San Antonio Sheriff's Office. These are both FOX-syndicated news stories. The content being scrubbed is probative, factual in nature and relevant, and, is far from being "sensationalist" or tabloid news. The fact that vast conspiracy theories are affiliated with gang stalking is irrelevant to the value of these two factually-based news stories. There are many academic topics that are mired in conspiracy from the moon landing to the J.F.K. assassination. The litmus test should be the quality and content of the materials redacted, not the conspiracy label.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:PeaceFrog71" class="mw-redirect" title="User:PeaceFrog71">PeaceFrog71</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:PeaceFrog71" title="User talk:PeaceFrog71">talk</a>) 13:58, 9 July 2012 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Please address Batvette's concerns, which are the central issue at the moment. This article has been the target of sensationalist claims, the residue of which is presently being debated to establish whether the sources fully support the content. We wish to avoid sensationalism and to promote inclusion of appropriately cited and supported material: "scrubbing" is not the aim, factual accuracy and appropriate weight based on the level of coverage in mainstream media is what's required. <b><font face="Arial"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Acroterion" title="User:Acroterion"><font color="black">Acroterion</font></a> <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Acroterion" title="User talk:Acroterion"><font color="gray">(talk)</font></a></small></font></b> 14:05, 9 July 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Both articles are mainstream media news stories and contain information derived from law enforcement officials. There has been no impeachment of the content of the stories. Batvette's argument that the stories are the residue of "sensationalist" claims is irrelevant. Nothing has been adduced to impeach the credibility of the two news stories citing law enforcement concerns and investigations in both California and Texas. The entire rationale behind the redaction is the use of the term "gang stalking" in both news stories. This term has been adopted for activities of reported group stalking by some law enforcement officials. The redaction based upon the terminology "gang stalking", of otherwise highly probative material on group stalking, is cosmetic and semantic. Suggestion:
</p><p>Some commentators have used the controversial term "gang stalking" to refer to reported cases of stalking by groups. [ft]

<dd>I'd still be interested to know what happened to the polling data on that DOJ form about who respondents believe the groups were associated with.

<dl><dd>Fair enough but if you applied this- <i>It's an opinion piece, by someone with no demonstrated authority in the subject, nor any indication of investigation or training in the material.</i> as a standard for RS on wiki, 80% of its content would be removed overnight. The rationale I could see for not including it in the article amount to that it's from cracked, which is explicitly mentioned in the RS policy as worthy of exclusion, and it adds a bit of circus to an otherwise encyclopedic article. Not that it's inaccurate or not well researched. It does reflect the reality of what is described in the existing content quite well. I'm not pushing hard to keep it however, I didn't even add it in the first place. I think merely adding the link to the existing references which are inclusive in media sources, without specifically citing cracked's own claim, would suffice.

<dl><dd>We are not diminishing anyone's credibility. By only including content the can be attributed to reliable sources we are simply making a decision that this encyclopedia is not the approprite place for such information, not giving any opinion about its truth status. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Phil_Bridger" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Phil Bridger">Phil Bridger</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Phil_Bridger" title="User talk:Phil Bridger">talk</a>) 19:59, 14 October 2012 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It is not clear why anyone who wishes to "research a victim's claims" would come to Wikipedia to do so. If a person claimed criminal activity was happening to them would it not be appropriate to observe things that were happening in the vicinity of that person? How would it prove something is happening to one person if someone can find it happens to someone else far away? Doesn't this really validate the theory of this being a product of a group belief system if for one to be convinced something is happening, they must go on the internet and find that strangers in other places also believe the same thing?</dd>
<dd>This is why this issue will never see the "balanced presentation" some would like, as the desire seems to be that a wiki article should exist to provide a resource some would use to validate their beliefs. Gang Stalking  has not been credibly documented to actually exist other than a few isolated instances of vague resemblance which were quite different than the wide spread phenomenon claimed by internet GS "activists". Misleading people and encouraging such belief systems is an agenda that's never going to happen here.</dd>
<dd>To be more direct, if one believes this is happening to them don't send people to wiki or anywhere else on the internet hoping the stories of others will support your own- and don't seek to be "educated" by people who want you to share in their own foolish self ruination.  Get a video camera and compile evidence for <i>your</i> experiences and claims and take control of your situation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Batvette" title="User:Batvette">Batvette</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Batvette" title="User talk:Batvette">talk</a>) 16:00, 25 October 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Hi. The article already has a section dedicated to stalking by groups, which is a relatively common phenomenon that has been reported by numerous sources, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking#Stalking_by_groups" title="Stalking">Stalking#Stalking by groups</a>. Examples include members of a gang or a family cooperating in persecuting an individual.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>However, from the links above, you seem to be referring to harrassment of individuals by organized, highly sophisticated groups using electronic weapons, etc., a phenomenon popularly known as "gang stalking". One common theme in these is the reported use of high-technology weaponry capable of delivering harm in an invisible way, a theme which can be seen in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tilly_Matthews" title="James Tilly Matthews">James Tilly Matthews</a>' reports of the "Air Loom" that he believed was used to attack him. The problem with this alleged phenomenon is the lack of any verifiable evidence for its existence <i>as a real phenomenon</i>, other than anecdotal evidence by its self-described targets. On the other hand, these anecdotal accounts are sufficiently common that they are themselves a well-described and verifiable phenomenon, generally regarded by experts in the field as delusional in nature, which the article reports on in a separate section.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>This does not mean that Wikipedia has set its face forever against including this in the article: only that the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">verifiability</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:N" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:N">notability</a> criteria apply to it as any other topic. If publically available evidence from multiple independent reliable sources (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:V" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:V">WP:V</a> for the exact criteria) suggesting that these phenomena were real were to come to light, the same rules would allow this article to be changed for them to be reported as such.  Until then, however, the current state of affairs is likely to continue.

I'm just curious...if "gang stalking" is not verifiable, why is it even mentioned? To me, sandwiching the term "gang stalking" right in between "false accusations" and "delusions of persecution" smacks of weasel-wording! I thought Wikipedia had rules against that? Wikipedia, at least for me, is the first place I go for information about a subject. I assume that could be true for most people. If people really are suffering from the terror of being stalked by multiple people, this wording seems to do them a disservice. Why not just remove "gang stalking" altogether? Thanks for your consideration!  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/75.139.155.164" title="Special:Contributions/75.139.155.164">75.139.155.164</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:75.139.155.164&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:75.139.155.164 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:57, 7 April 2013 (UTC)</span>

<dl><dd>It is verifiable that gang stalking, in the sense used at the start of this discussion, exists as a delusion, but not that it exists as a real phenomenon. It is therefore perfectly correct for us to cover it in this way. It is unfortunate that the phrase "gang stalking" has been hijacked by a few believers in a ridiculous conspiracy theory to have this meaning rather than simply that of stalking by several people working together, but we have to work with the language as it is actually used rather than as we would like it to be. If people suffering from the terror of this kind of stalking come to this page, very likely fuelled by the various internet fora on the subject, we are in fact doing them a great service by explaining the fact that there is nothing to be terrified about. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Phil_Bridger" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Phil Bridger">Phil Bridger</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Phil_Bridger" title="User talk:Phil Bridger">talk</a>) 07:31, 7 April 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Removal_of_properly_sourced_information">Removal of properly sourced information</span></h2>
<p>Several times information sourced from the same Washington Post article has been removed from this article.  The article presents no conclusions regarding the status of gang-stalking, yet the wikipedia editors continue to present it as if it does.  In addition, a U.S. House Bill was cited, and removed also, which supports information in the conclusion of the Washington Post article.  At this point I would consider the removal of properly sourced information which properly portrays the tone of the article malicious.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239" title="Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239">65.7.161.239</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:65.7.161.239" title="User talk:65.7.161.239">talk</a>) 16:51, 27 April 2013 (UTC)</span>

<dl><dd>The <i>Washington Post</i> article most certainly does not support the ludicrous claims that you have tried to put in the article. Your, and others', agenda is perfectly clear from your attempts to remove the phrase "gang stalking" from the article, in an obvious attempt to stop it coming near the top of web search results and leave the field clear for the really malicious stuff, <i>i.e.</i> the web sites that encourage people who believe such things not to seek the medical assistance that they need. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Phil_Bridger" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Phil Bridger">Phil Bridger</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Phil_Bridger" title="User talk:Phil Bridger">talk</a>) 19:02, 27 April 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Phil, the "ludicrous claims" you refer to are copied word for word from the Washington Post article, in the conclusion no less.  Please take the time to read the entire article before you attempt to present it's results in an unbaised manner on Wikipedia.  The quotes are taken from page 5, if you have not gotten that far.  What is your reason for removing the citation to Senator Kucinich's bill?  Again, these are not my opinions or statements, they are properly cited from the *same* article you are sourcing.  Your presentation is biased, and if either of us has an "agenda" you are the one routinely and maliciously presenting an inaccurate picture of the material you are citing.  Further, you take it upon yourself to decide people holding "certain beliefs" need medical attention (again, not supported by any of the material presented here), yet continue to remove information that could lead them to support groups, which are again noted as being beneficial in the article.   For your edification, my "agenda" here is the preservation of truth, search results have no meaning to me. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239" title="Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239">65.7.161.239</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:65.7.161.239" title="User talk:65.7.161.239">talk</a>) 01:51, 28 April 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I can agree that mind control is irrelevant to stalking, still, the commentary does not accurately reflect the sourced article, nor common sense.  Assuming that all victims of group stalking are delusional is preposterous.  There is a significant amount of evidence from both the DOJ and FBI corroborating the existence of "community based stalking."  I think we are quibbling over words here, "gang stalking" may mean one thing to you, and another to me.  Regardless, the Washington Post article clearly is referring to the claims related to "mind control" as possibly delusional, not the claims of stalking.  If we are to remove the Washington Post's unbiased commentary on that subject, the delusional commentary in Wikipedia should be removed also.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239" title="Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239">65.7.161.239</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:65.7.161.239" title="User talk:65.7.161.239">talk</a>) 02:13, 28 April 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I read the cite. Apart from a single mention of stalking early on, the article is about paranoid delusions of mind control, not about stalking.

<dl><dd>Thanks for reading the article.  It happens to be the same one that is currently cited referring to stalking victims as "delusional." I'll re-suggest removing the delusional comments, since we all now agree that the articles cited are inappropriate for this page.  Aside from the NY Times article about the same group, with the same unbiased approach, there are no other sources cited in the current incarnation of the page.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239" title="Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239">65.7.161.239</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:65.7.161.239" title="User talk:65.7.161.239">talk</a>) 03:22, 28 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>"Apart from a single mention of stalking early on, the article is about paranoid delusions of mind control, not about stalking."  Now that I am suggesting stalking victims are not delusional you are changing your opinion?  I disagree, the article is inappropriate for a Stalking page.  And again, if the material referring to mind control delusions stays, it's inappropriate not to provide the contrary opinion which is clearly expressed throughout the article. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239" title="Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239">65.7.161.239</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:65.7.161.239" title="User talk:65.7.161.239">talk</a>) 04:17, 28 April 2013 (UTC) 
</p><p>Prior to the lines in question, we have clearly stated statistical and scientific results that show that a significant portion, well over thirty percent, of victims of group stalking are <i>not</i> suffering from a delusion.  The remainder of the article goes on to imply that all possible victims must be delusional, and has the capacity to put this group of actual victims in potential danger.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239" title="Special:Contributions/65.7.161.239">65.7.161.239</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:65.7.161.239" title="User talk:65.7.161.239">talk</a>) 04:51, 28 April 2013 (UTC)</span> 
</p><p>Further, the article mentions a myriad of weapons and concludes based on absolutely no factual evidence that they are delusional.  Point in fact, both the originally cited article as well as the Congressional legislation specifically indicate that the technology is real.  The verbiage used, as well as the tone of the article are completely inappropriate, and dismiss the existence of documented technology for no reason at all.
</p><p>So we can discuss it:
</p><p>For a "medical opinion", from page 3:
</p>
<dl><dd>Girard sought advice from this then-girlfriend, a practicing psychologist, whom he declines to identify. He says she told him, "Nobody can become psychotic in their late 40s." She said he didn't seem to manifest other symptoms of psychotic behavior -- he dressed well, paid his bills -- and, besides his claims of surveillance, which sounded paranoid, he behaved normally.</dd></dl>
<p>The entire 4th and 5th pages cite verified research into governmental operations which verify that the technology possibly exists.  In fact, the majority of the article is dedicated to a first hand account of a group meeting, and listing possible technologies which could cause the symptoms described.  Out of a five page article, Wikipedia has chosen to source 1 line taken from three small paragraphs, out of a five page article, (approximately 2%) dealing with the medical opinion of the possibility that the group is suffering from a delusion, the vast majority of the content does not agree.  It's an obviously biased reading of the article, and not including at least some of the refutation which is papered all over the original work is improper and lacks integrity.  
</p><p>The content which I added, refers to technology listed and verified in the article, as well as in legislation in the US Congress.  Have you heard of MK-ULTRA?  Presenting the material the way it currently stands has the potential for grave social implications in the future; if this phenomenon ever does, even in a small way, turn out to be related to a government operation.  Even if it does not, the conclusions drawn in the WIkipedia article are completely unsupported in the sourced material.
</p><p>Specifically: "These are generally reported by external observers as being examples of belief systems, as opposed to reports of objective phenomena."  Is an uncited and generalized opinion.
</p><p>And: "Some psychiatrists and psychologists say web sites that amplify reports of mind control and group stalking are "an extreme community that may encourage delusional thinking" and represent a dark side of social networking. They may reinforce the troubled thinking of the mentally ill and impede treatment." is the only line sourced from an article which contains an overwhelming amount of information that supports a contrary view.
</p><p>Forgive me, but your comment that you get "delusional" in spades is a reflection of your opinion of these victims description of mind control, not a clear reflection of the cited work.
</p><p>From the fifth page,
</p><p><i>Meanwhile, the military's use of weapons that employ electromagnetic radiation to create pain is well-known, as are some of the limitations of such weapons.</i> In 2001, the Pentagon declassified one element of this research: the Active Denial System, a weapon that uses electromagnetic radiation to heat skin and create an intense burning sensation. So, yes, there is technology designed to beam painful invisible rays at humans, but the weapon seems to fall far short of what could account for many of the TIs' symptoms. While its exact range is classified, Doug Beason, an expert in directed-energy weapons, puts it at about 700 meters, and the beam cannot penetrate a number of materials, such as aluminum. <i>Considering the size of the full-scale weapon, which resembles a satellite dish, and its operational limitations, the ability of the government or anyone else to shoot beams at hundreds of people</i> -- on city streets, into their homes and while they travel in cars and planes -- <i>is beyond improbable.</i>
</p><p><i>But, given the history of America's clandestine research, it's reasonable to assume that if the defense establishment could develop mind-control or long-distance ray weapons, it almost certainly would. And, once developed, the possibility that they might be tested on innocent civilians could not be categorically dismissed.</i>
</p><p>I'd suggestion adding the italicized text, in order to remain at least somewhat unbiased.

<dl><dd>My mental health has no bearing on this. My particular condition affects things such as my mood and concentration, but does not impair my cognition.

My objection is to your lengthy discussion of psychotronic weapons, using the <i>Washington Post</i> article as a pretext, and your removal of references to delusional behavior.  In essence, you're trying to insinuate that these peoples' problems really <i>are</i> due to the use of some form of mind control. The concise mention already in the text about delusional behavior (extending to perceptions of persecution using unconventional means) is appropriate and supported by the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Washington Post</i> references. Further expansion of the material would represent undue weight. The primary reference is the <i>Times</i> (which is mostly concerned with perceptions of stalking and mind control) and the secondary reference is the <i>Post</i>, which centers mainly on manifestations of delusional behavior. As I noted, the <i>Times</i> article is probably more useful, as it focuses on the phenomenon, while the <i>Post</i> article is a feature article mostly concerned with the victims of such delusions. They don't support a further discussion, and your campaign to remove the term "delusional" goes against those references. <b><font face="Arial"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Acroterion" title="User:Acroterion"><font color="black">Acroterion</font></a> <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Acroterion" title="User talk:Acroterion"><font color="gray">(talk)</font></a></small></font></b> 13:48, 29 April 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Really?  Please check the edit log again, I <i>removed nothing about delusional beliefs</i>, point in fact, I added to that argument as well.  All I did was follow WP:RS and include the other viewpoint presented in the sourced article.  Right now this page is in violation of that policy, <b>please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a></b>.  My "campaign" has been to either remove the article in its entirety, or to add the secondary viewpoint, which is presented prominently in both the NY Times and Washington Post article.  This isn't really a discussion, the article as it stands does not properly present the content of the source. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Damonthesis" title="User:Damonthesis">Damonthesis</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Damonthesis" title="User talk:Damonthesis">talk</a>) 17:32, 29 April 2013 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As far as "casting aspersions" please see the following page,<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://groups.google.com/group/ffchs-daily-harassment-log/index/browse_frm/month/2010-11?_done=/group/ffchs-daily-harassment-log/browse_frm/month/2010-11?&amp;&amp;pli=1">https://groups.google.com/group/ffchs-daily-harassment-log/index/browse_frm/month/2010-11?_done=/group/ffchs-daily-harassment-log/browse_frm/month/2010-11?&amp;&amp;pli=1</a> In which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Batvette" title="User:Batvette">User:Batvette</a> has 31 posts in a single month to a support group for "gang stalking."  Check out some of the comments, this user clearly has a vested interest in presenting a biased opinion from sourced material which does not. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Damonthesis" title="User:Damonthesis">Damonthesis</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Damonthesis" title="User talk:Damonthesis">talk</a>) 17:38, 29 April 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>As I said, you're abusing the <i>Post</i> article as a pretext for a long tangent on an unrelated subject, using speculation in the article to make the article on stalking into a coatrack for mind control theories. You've also demanded the removal of "delusion" (I'm assuming you're the IP above), despite its ample support by the sourcing and context of the article. The purely speculative passage, and therefore non-RS passage on mind control rays is one reason why I prefer the <i>Times</i> article as a more useful, straightforward source. And again, stop with the speculation about other editors. <b><font face="Arial"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Acroterion" title="User:Acroterion"><font color="black">Acroterion</font></a> <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Acroterion" title="User talk:Acroterion"><font color="gray">(talk)</font></a></small></font></b> 17:55, 29 April 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'm not demanding the removal of anything.  I'm telling you that if the source is used, WP:RS demands that we provide both viewpoints presented in the source article, especially since the wikipedia article already contains references to "mind control rays."  I'm not sure why you are taking the position that the article should be sourced improperly, make a medical diagnosis based on the opinion of a news article, all contrary to Wikipedia policy.  About the Times article:
<dl><dd>"Although many Internet groups that offer peer support are considered helpful to the mentally ill, some experts say Web sites that amplify reports of mind control and group stalking represent a dark side of social networking. They may reinforce the troubled thinking of the mentally ill and impede treatment." is the paragraph sourced, and the only lines taken out support the viewpoint that "peer support can be helpful."  If you don't see this as a biased presentation of the source, you haven't looked at it.  In the same article this follows: <i>Mental health experts who have closely looked at the Web sites are careful to say that there is no way to prove if someone posting on, say, Mr. Robinson’s site, Freedomfchs.com, which says its mission is to seek justice for those singled out by “organized stalking and electromagnetic torture,” is suffering from mental illness.</i>  Again, the editors here are presenting a biased viewpoint that is specifically disproven in the source.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a> states that even <i>minority viewpoints</i> need to be presented, and this is not that--it's a fact stated incontrovertibly in <i>your</i> source.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Both the Times and Post article present, after their analysis, information regarding legislators who have attempted to investigate or legislate regarding the "weapons" in question.  Yet this article represents neither.  In the Post it talks about Kucinich's bill, and in the Times article about Representative Jim Guest.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Guest's statement: “I’ve had enough calls, some from credible people — professors — being targeted by nonlethal weapons,” Mr. Guest said in a telephone interview, adding that nothing came of his request for a legislative investigation. “They become psychologically affected by it. They have trouble sleeping at night.” He added: “I believe there are people who have been targeted by this. With this equipment, you have to test it on somebody to see if it works.”  These people are United States Representatives and Senators, you cannot assume to put your personal opinion forward above theirs.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>No matter how you slice it, you will not be able to properly source either article with the opinion that a large group of people is "delusional" when there is significant evidence in both articles, as well as the already sourced "Characteristics of False Stalking Reports" that clearly states well above 30% of these cases are <i>not the result of delusion.</i>  Again, misrepresenting the sourced newspaper articles, and using them to refute a published study you have already cited, <i>puts this 30% of real victims in danger</i>.  It is <i>not</i> a factual representation of any of the material cited. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Damonthesis" title="User:Damonthesis">Damonthesis</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Damonthesis" title="User talk:Damonthesis">talk</a>) 18:28, 29 April 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Just to summarize, you are representing the minority opinion of two news articles as the entirety of your source material for this section; you are presenting this minority opinion as fact, and refusing to include the opposing opinion presented in both articles.  This section is in gross violation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>.   In addition, yourself, and two other editors have, over the course of <b>five years</b> continually argued to present this group of people as "suffering from a group delusion" despite numerous requests from the public to include the majority opinion in the articles cited:  that the delusional status of this group is questionable, the technology possibly exists, and numerous Federal legislators have not only agreed with the opinion that they are not delusional, but have presented legislation to ban the weapons and investigate "community Stalking."  The lack of inclusion of these facts presents a completely biased and uninformed opinion as a fact, which is held by a minority of Wikipedia editors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Acroterion" title="User:Acroterion">User:Acroterion</a> himself, after reading the only sourced material on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking" title="Stalking">Stalking</a> referring to "gang stalking", said that they were inappropriate for the stalking page, and subsequently insinuated that I was "championing" removing the information, while the only argument I have had was to follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Damonthesis" title="User:Damonthesis">Damonthesis</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Damonthesis" title="User talk:Damonthesis">talk</a>) 18:48, 29 April 2013 (UTC)

<p>Hi, it seems to me that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SharabSalam" title="User:SharabSalam">User:SharabSalam</a> might have made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PERSONAL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PERSONAL">WP:PERSONAL</a> attack against me: <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJamal_Khashoggi&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=959812052&amp;oldid=959808221">diff</a>. Normally, I would not care but because SharabSalam has already been blocked 4 times (and unbclocked twice), and personal attacks were a contributing factor once, perhaps some action is advisable; I want to draw others' attention to it. Also it seems he was to "avoid articles related to slavery" per one of the unblocks but from time to time he edits them: <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abolitionism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=958644585">diff</a> (NB he self-reverted this edit, and his other edits related to slavery seem to be reverting obvious vandalism, though I did not delve deep into the history of any slavery-related page). Generally, it makes me think SharabSalam thinks little of the (un)blocks. As for me, even though I found his comment offensive, I do not know what action would be adequate, and if no action is deemed necessary, I am OK with it. (Also not sure if another/longer block would improve his behavior...) I suppose he makes useful contributions but I am just not sure other editors need to put up with this kind of behavior as Wikipedia is not only about content.

<dl><dd>SharabSalam has a tendency to attack-by-implication and then later apologize, so multiple violations are forgiven, until the next round, at least.

They're not trying to drive a Saudi agenda.

<dl><dd>I do have a negative view of the Saudi regime, not "on things involving Saudi Arabia". Most Yemenis do have a negative view of the Saudi regime. However, I have never made any disruptive, POV edit in Saudi Arabia-related articles. I have always remained neutral in these topics. I have said the word "Saudi Barbaria" once on Wikipedia, and I was talking in the reliable sources noticeboard about the Saudi regime press freedom. They kill journalists as we saw in the Jamal case. My point was that Saudi-based sources are as bad as Saudi-owned sources because of there is no freedom of press. And that was the whole point of what I said.--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SharabSalam" title="User:SharabSalam"><span style="color:#8D056C">SharʿabSalam▼</span></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SharabSalam" title="User talk:SharabSalam">talk</a>) 20:54, 1 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></li>

<li><b>Neutral</b> on the proposed tban on Saudi Arabia, but <b>strongly opposed</b> to a much broader tban covering Islam-related articles, as is being proposed below. A ban on editing anything related to a major religion is a very strong action. If an editor had a tendency to remove content critical of the Catholic Church, claiming it to be poorly sourced, we would not rush to tban such an editor from all Catholicism-related articles. I've tangled with such editors, especially on matters relating to abortion, but I've always been able to rely on consensus of other editors on those content issues and have never believed that those Catholic editors needed to be banned. As a non-Catholic, I believe that Wikipedia should <b>not</b> take punitive action against those Catholic editors (unless an extreme case occurred); and as a non-Muslim, I also believe that Wikipedia should <b>not</b> ban from Islam-related articles an editor who on occasion has objected to what they perceive as anti-Islam content, even if their objections to it sometimes were not well-grounded. Religious tolerance and even-handedness are important here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NightHeron" title="User:NightHeron">NightHeron</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NightHeron" title="User talk:NightHeron">talk</a>) 23:29, 1 June 2020 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> per TonyBallioni and El_C above for consistent POV editing and personal attacks. Also, per Debresser below, I believe we should stronger consider a broader topic ban covering Islamic subjects in general. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:YUEdits" class="mw-redirect" title="User:YUEdits">YUEdits</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:YUEdits" title="User talk:YUEdits">talk</a>) 02:26, 2 June 2020 (UTC)​

<li><b>Support</b> I am in agreement that this topic ban is not as broad as we probably need here.

<li><b>Note:</b> I <b>oppose an Islam TBAN</b>. The argument below is that he removed anti-Muslim content sourced to unreliable sources. Are we <i>really</i> going to sanction an Arab editor for removing anti-Muslim speech in a way that doesn’t violate any policy or attack any editor? If I did that I’d be given a barnstar. I think SharabSalam sees Saudi spies around every corner and needs a sanction because of that, but being paranoid about the Saudi government and calling others Saudi trolls, etc. is what’s disruptive. Removing an anti-Muslim hate blog is laudatory. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 04:08, 2 June 2020 (UTC)
<ul><li>He makes hundreds of edits so that is not really surprising, but also see other edits mentioned in the section below. What one should also see is that the existing topic ban on him from Iranian politics (1978 - present) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive1035#@SharabSalam:_making_bogus_accusations_against_admins" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/IncidentArchive1035">emerged on ANI</a> and this subject involves Islamic politics. Now we are discussing the Saudi Arabia related editing issues which again involves a Islamic country. I don't see how country-specific bans are really going to work anymore, thus it is better to make a broader topic ban. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Orientls" title="User:Orientls">Orientls</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Orientls" title="User talk:Orientls">talk</a>) 05:25, 2 June 2020 (UTC)
<ul><li>I wouldn’t object to a broader Middle East topic ban, but I’d pretty strongly oppose an Islam one. Like I said, he accused a Lebanese CU of being a pro-Saudi POV pusher and basically said the only Arab steward was a Saudi spy for opposing a local dialect wiki <small>(full disclosure: <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAuth/%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%A1" class="extiw" title="m:Special:CentralAuth/علاء"> علاء</a> is probably my closest friend on Wikimedia so I’m still angry about that.)</small> Now he’s doing the same crap on en.wiki that he was doing on meta and ar.wiki: the thing is, removing religionofpeace and synthesis/original research of primary sources from religion articles is almost always a good thing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 05:40, 2 June 2020 (UTC)

<ul><li>You realize I’m trying to prevent you from being unjustly sanctioned for removing anti-Muslim hate speech, right? As for your attacks on me: I turn down people asking me to run for steward every year because it doesn’t interest me. The odds of my running for steward are approximately zero, and are also not relevant to this discussion. And no, I’m not mad about you supporting standardized section headers. I’ve admitted I’m not particularly happy with you over your attacks on Ala’a, and that’s a bias, but you’re doing the exact same thing on this project, and since I know the history on meta and ar.wiki that is relevant, and others don’t, I’m going to raise it. I have said that I think your actions on this project have become increasingly a net negative over time, and <i>because</i> I am active cross-wiki and am very familiar with ar.wiki and meta, I know your history on those projects, which is applicable here since you’ve shown the same behaviour on multiple projects, and it’s been disruptive on all of them. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 06:05, 2 June 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>WTF are you even talking about? I have never attacked Alaa. You have got to be kidding me. Are you instigating Arab users against me?. That issue happened between me and the whole Arabic Wikipedia system. I have been so nice with Alaa. See my talk page in Arabic Wikipedia!. I have only objected the way they revert edits, all of them. They don't write edit summaries. I don't think you know Arabic Wikipedia. I have never had any issue with you. It all started when I supported a proposal to have a standard AN/I. Before that you were so nice with me. Even in meta Wikimedia.<a class="external autonumber" href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TonyBallioni&amp;oldid=19187143#Sana&#39;ani_Arabic">[9]</a> I have been blocked in Arabic Wikipedia because of the username <b>only</b>, nothing about my contributions. I wasn't able to speak English very well when I joined English Wikipedia but I just joined because every edit I make in Arabic Wikipedia is being reverted. Most articles in Arabic Wikipedia don't make any sense, because they are clearly translations and when someone tries to fix that he gets reverted. Months ago, someone emailed me telling me to make a complaint in meta Wikipedia and to provide evidence. I didn't want to do that but now I will, when I have time, make a complaint and provide tons of evidences of non-free Arabic Wikipedia. In any case, you dont seem to be neutral. You have said many mean things to me like saying that other editors dont hate Saudis like I do <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049556"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">"<b>They just don't hate them as much as you</b>"</q> and that I am "<b>being paranoid about the Saudi government </b>".

<li><b>Support</b> topic ban from the subject of Saudi Arabia. Partly after reading this here, and partly after reading the recent discussion on SharabSalam's talk page with TonyBallioni, I have to conclude that SharabSalam does not appear to be open to considering how he is coming across or to listening when other people try to explain it. The clearest example is right here, in that "<i>oh wait that's the same language that pro-Trump, pro-Saudi trolls use ... How coincidental!</i>" comment. Even if that wasn't intended as a personal attack likening an editor to a pro-Trump, pro-Saudi troll, it's undoubtedly how it comes across. And I see a steadfast refusal to even consider that. In fact, had I seen that comment before the discussion here commenced, I would have blocked for it. My fear is that SharabSalam is heading for an eventual exclusion from this project, which would be unfortunate, and I hope a topic ban here might act as a wake up call and prevent that happening. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Boing!_said_Zebedee" title="User:Boing! said Zebedee">Boing! said Zebedee</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Boing!_said_Zebedee" title="User talk:Boing! said Zebedee">talk</a>) 11:11, 2 June 2020 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment.</b> I don't want to fully weigh in here, but I have to say that idea we would TBAN SharabSalam for that "Saudi Barbaria" comment would be pantently absurd. (1) The dude is not a native English language speaker and probably has no clue the deeper implications behind call a place barbaric. <small>He didn't even know what "whiny *****" meant.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive1035#Apologize" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/IncidentArchive1035">link</a></sup></small> (2) He lives in Yemen. You guys know there is an active <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Civil_War_(2015%E2%80%93present)" title="Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)">civil war</a> there, right? It's just a wee bit tense there.. (3) Saudi Arabia has done some pretty awful things, so let's not pretend that a user biased against them is all that surprising.<br />If people want to support this TBAN for the reasons Tony outlined, that's one thing. To TBAN for that one single comment from five months ago, that's pretty absurd.<br />I'd also completely oppose a ban on the broad topic of the Middle East. That's like TBANing an English person from the entire topic of Western Europe. That's greatly disproportional to anything I have seen be alleged SharabSalam to have done. &#8211;<span style="font-family:CG Times"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MJL" title="User:MJL"><span style="color:black">MJL</span></a>&#8201;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MJL" title="User talk:MJL">‐<b>Talk</b>‐</a><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Connecticut" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Connecticut">☖</a></sup></span> 02:43, 3 June 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>TonyBallioni, so renaming and vanishing are now the same procedure?  One sort of anticipates further contribution from the editor.

<dl><dd>Vanishing is done using the rename function, so normally the global rename policy is applied. Like I said, there's also a sometimes spoken sometimes unspoken assumption that rage quits happen, and are more likely to happen when someone is under stress of being discussed at a noticeboard.

There is nothing that said it <i>had to be reversed</i>. The original renamer said it was okay to reverse, and two global renamers agreed that it should be reversed. The <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:GlobalRenameQueue/request/64228/view" class="extiw" title="m:Special:GlobalRenameQueue/request/64228/view">original request</a> had no mention of privacy concerns, so there wasn't any need to look into it further. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nihlus" title="User:Nihlus"><span style="padding:2px 2px;font-variant:small-caps;color:#000;letter-spacing:-0.5px"><b>Nihlus</b></span></a> 03:46, 4 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></li></ul>

<dl><dd><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:QEDK" title="User:QEDK">QEDK</a>, here's how I view it. Someone wants to vanish, fine, they get to vanish. As long as they're not some prolific vandal or something (and SharabSalam is not, regardless of whether any of us might agree or disagree with him) then let them go. Once. Whatever shit they may happen to be in at that point. "I choose to walk away" should always be an option.</dd>

<dl><dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:QEDK" title="User:QEDK">QEDK</a>:</span> It's not that you said they were malicious, but you brought up a point about maliciousness in a case where it supposedly did not apply. If you don't believe Sharab is malicious, why do we need to argue about where the line is? Since Sharab was editing in good faith, if the spirit is avoiding harm from malicious users, then <i>not</i> following the letter better complies with the spirit. My point is and was that focusing on the specific letter of the policy isn't helpful. As Nil Einne explains below, it's not even clear that the wording you point to has particularly broad consensus.<div class="paragraphbreak" style="margin-top:0.5em"></div>Despite the page name, I (and perhaps others) view this as a <i>right</i> not a courtesy. The <a href="http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/RightToVanish" class="extiw" title="meatball:RightToVanish">meatball:RightToVanish</a> essay was the basis for our early vanishing policy and--along with Barnstars and Assume Good Faith--the right to vanish represents one of the oldest parts of our community. SarahSV created our RTV policy page in 2007, copying it from meta. Meta's right to vanish was created in 2004 and was spun out from our first privacy policy where it was added by an IP in 2003. People change, communities change, and risks change. Unlike social media accounts or blogs, if we change our mind and want to abandon our connection to the content we've created, Wikipedians cannot simply delete our accounts or content (and people used to do that on wikis: <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiMindWipe" class="extiw" title="c2:WikiMindWipe">c2:WikiMindWipe</a>). As a matter of privacy and decency, we should afford good faith editors the right to renounce their connection to their contributions through vanishing should they choose to leave our project permanently. If we need to reverse the vanishing later so be it, but either way all the important stuff is kept. We gain nothing from a weak right to vanish but stand to lose a lot without a strong one. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">— <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wugapodes" title="User:Wugapodes">Wug·</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Wugapodes" title="User talk:Wugapodes">a·po·des</a>​</span> 07:50, 10 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<li>I am very much of the view that the harder we make it for people to leave with dignity, the more we stoke resentment and invite further abuse. If someone wants to leave, let them. Honestly.

<dl><dd>All of you do realize that you can leave anyway right, without executing a RTV? If someone wants to leave, all they need to do is scramble their password. RTV is just so you can be renamed into some gibberish and <i>possibly</i> have a clean start, edit history and talk pages are always preserved anyway, so the fact that a few more things are retained has literally no bearing on a clean start and is mostly extended as a courtesy to editors in good standing (in case of SharabSalam, that's unclear, since they were the subject of a sanction discussion at the time of requesting RTV).

<dl><dd>@<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:QEDK" title="User:QEDK">qedk</a>: SharabSalam has had an active sanction against him since before this discussion started (linked above), so there is very little chance of him being an eligible for a clean start (without explicit invocation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IAR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:IAR">WP:IAR</a> or something).<br />Regarding the RTV/leaving thing, I'd just let people say what they're going to say.

<dd>But people can have strong attachments to their user names, especially if they have been used outside Wikipedia, and often even when they aren't. So even when an account name cannot be easily tied to a real name, demanding that we keep unnecessary connections seems, well unnecessary. Both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RTV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RTV">WP:RTV</a> makes it clear that editors who have engaged in that process cannot undergo a clean start. If they want to return, their vanishing is liable to be reversed or at least their connection to the old account will need to be clearly disclosed and will be considered in any request to return to editing. I think that's fair enough too. And as others have said, when the it's necessary to keep that connection so help us in tracking them e.g. for a known sock, sure it's fair enough that RTV is denied. But I agree with others that it's not clear why it was needed in this case. There seems to be no benefit to us, but there is potential harm to both us and the editor involved. Note that I have no real feelings about the editor either way. I just don't see any reason why we need to keep the unnecessary stuff when there is no apparent need to track them anymore and we already make it clear that if you later decide to return you will need to come back under you original identity so your return can be properly assessed. But until then, if you want to stay away, and you do stay away, then we're not going to keep unnecessary connections. The edit history, AN//I discussions etc will be preserved as they need to be and always will be. The other stuff especially the username in the editor history, we can remove. The most confusing thing to me about this is I'm fairly sure I've seen RTV afforded to editors who are under strong sanction e.g. an indef block, or I think even a community ban or arbcom ban afforded the RTV in the past. Also some where the vanishing does risk causing problems i.e. an editor with a known sock history. And indeed a read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Courtesy_vanishing/Archive_1" title="Wikipedia talk:Courtesy vanishing/Archive 1">Wikipedia talk:Courtesy vanishing/Archive 1</a> seems to agree with me. Have we gotten a lot stricter recently, or is it just that because this editor decided to RTV when they were under discussion and therefore additional scrutiny, even if it seemed clear that any outcome would be no worse than when we normally allow RTV, they were treated different? P.S. If you check out that page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Risker" title="User:Risker">User:Risker</a>'s comments back in 2016 <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Courtesy_vanishing&amp;diff=700379339&amp;oldid=700051600">[11]</a> are similar to how I feel now. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nil_Einne" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nil_Einne" title="User talk:Nil Einne">talk</a>) 20:34, 9 June 2020 (UTC)

It's equivalent to wanting it both ways, ensuring that things you do aren't tied to your username as well being able to wipe your history (to a limited extent). The way I see it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RTV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RTV">WP:RTV</a> is a courtesy and if you feel that's not how it should be then you should propose changing it, what's not OK is justifying written policy with arbitrary notions. Should the RTV policy be more lenient? Maybe, whether the community feels that way should be debated in a RfC and not at an AN thread. I'm sure there have been cases where RTV has been done on a indeffed account because someone didn't read through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RTV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RTV">WP:RTV</a> or just straight-up invoked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IAR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:IAR">WP:IAR</a> but that's never a suitable reason to subvert policy.

<dl><dd>We're not resolving it unilaterally; we're having a discussion about it because it <i>was</i> dealt with unilaterally when the renaming was reversed. I struggle to find in the text of that policy such a strict interpretation as you seem to understand. As Sarah has discussed above, nothing in the text <i>requires</i> we deny vanishing to those "under a cloud" or even indefinitely blocked users. Consider: <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r886049556"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">Vanishing is not a way to avoid criticism, sanctions, or other negative attention, <b>unless you really mean to leave permanently</b></q> (emphasis added).

From my understanding of what "might" means, it does not denote a requirement but rather a description of what <i>could</i> happen. The meta policy is arguably less restrictive. Saying that we need to propose a change is nonsense; we've advocated an interpretation that is squarely within the literal meaning of current policy text and given historical evidence for the spirit of the policy which led to the development of the current text. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">— <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wugapodes" title="User:Wugapodes">Wug·</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Wugapodes" title="User talk:Wugapodes">a·po·des</a>​</span> 19:49, 10 June 2020 (UTC)

<p>I just had a closer look at this editor, who recently tagged my talkpage with a warning template, and found that on many occasions he has removed negative information about Islam on grounds that seem trumped up to me (excuse the pun). Claiming primary source, unreliable source or original research he removed large paragraphs in edits like <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abomination_(Judaism)&amp;diff=958567801&amp;oldid=936724475">[12]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism_in_Islam&amp;diff=958377944&amp;oldid=956287172">[13]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_hadith&amp;diff=958569288&amp;oldid=958015802">[14]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Women_in_Islam&amp;diff=958145409&amp;oldid=958116573">[15]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ghassanids&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=954742383">[16]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Al-Baqarah&amp;diff=958953395&amp;oldid=957810320">[17]</a><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Religious_offense&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=955779410">[18]</a>. Primary sources is not in itself a reason to remove information, and frankly these claims seem trumped up in order to allow this editor to remove information which he feels is compromising for Islam. By the way, please notice that I am not claiming to have researched the reliability of each and every source and the sourcing of each and every claim he has removed. I am however seeing the bigger picture here, and it looks very suspicious. Since this is a long-term problem, and one that is much harder to recognize than a personal attack, I don't know what should be done, although I for myself have reached the conclusion that this editor should be banned from all Islam-related articles or simply blocked, since the long-term effects of his edit pattern are very detrimental to the project. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Debresser" title="User:Debresser">Debresser</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Debresser" title="User talk:Debresser">talk</a>) 20:48, 1 June 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>You have not researched the reliability of these sources? Like did you see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/">thereligionofpeace</a>? Did you also see that these sources are all primary and all the content is original research?. You just reverted me without seeing whether what I said was wrong or not. For the template, you were editwarring and you got warned for editwarring. The admin at the editwarring noticeboard also warned you.

<dl><dd>As I said, primary sources are not forbidden, and are actually often used in articles about religion. And no, I don't think that this content is all original research.

<dl><dd>But original research is forbidden. You didnt actually look at any of what I said. You, as you said above, assumed that I removed that content because I "feel is compromising for Islam." Thats interesting. Why did you assume that and not look at whether what I said was wrong or not?. You have provided many diffs and I have explained my edits in all of them. If you have a content dispute, we can discuss that in another place. You brought this here, why? You said I am removing content because I "feel is compromising for Islam." Could you provide any evidence? The diffs are all justified. Can you tell me where I was wrong in each of these diffs and why?. I would appreciate if you provided more insight to the problem that you are accusing me of.--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SharabSalam" title="User:SharabSalam"><span style="color:#8D056C">SharʿabSalam▼</span></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SharabSalam" title="User talk:SharabSalam">talk</a>) 21:17, 1 June 2020 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd>As I said, I didn't have the time to check each statement and each source. Blogs are of course bad sources, regardless of their POVs, no doubt.

<ul><li>Speaking generally: I don’t see this as relevant to the discussion. Removing anti-Muslim hate blogs and synthesis/original research from religion articles is a good thing. Most religion articles here are filled with it, and an Arab editor removing it is no different than my gutting Catholic articles sourced to early 20th century Protestant polemics: obviously a good thing. If there are specific instances where the sourcing has actually been evaluated, raise it on the article talk page first. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 06:15, 2 June 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dl><dd>I disagree.

<dd>^^^Thus spake El_C: arguably, too, alerts are even more important for new users as,  while an established editor might be <i>assumed</i> to not need reminding of the restrictions (yet still is), a new editor will have no idea.  By not advising them of the sanctions in place,  in fact,  you're making it more likely that they'll be breached.

<dl><dd><big><big>↑</big></big>What they said. It's a lot better to issue a neutral "you're dealing with a topic where the usual rules don't apply, if you're not confident that you understand all the rules around NPOV, sourcing, and inter-editor interaction, we suggest you start off in a less contentious area" warning from the outset. The alternative is that someone in good faith tries to add something they read on the internet about homeopathy/climate change/gun control, or thinks in good faith that they're improving Wikipedia by adding/removing an infobox on every page, and promptly gets themselves blocked. I do agree that the wording of the templates is incomprehensible and intimidating, but thus far nobody has come up with an alternative; that big gobbet of Bradspeak is unfortunately necessary if we're to convey precisely what "discretionary sanctions" does and doesn't mean.&#160;&#8209;&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Iridescent" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Iridescent">Iridescent</a> 08:13, 6 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dl><dd><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Levivich" title="User:Levivich">User:Levivich</a> Don't go for the heading only. The editor in question was one day account only. What harm would happen if the sanction alert is given after one week of non-disruptive editing? What did I say? Don't warn them ever? Warning should be given if they show signs of disruptive editing at the beginning.

<dd>I often DS template new editors. But, I always preface with a welcome if one doesn’t exist. As the welcome says their contributions are welcome and we hope they stay, it further softens the warning. Experienced editors are regularly sanctioned on DS articles. If they run into difficulties; new editors need some sort of heads-up that they’ve jumped into the deep end. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Objective3000" title="User:Objective3000">O3000</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Objective3000" title="User talk:Objective3000">talk</a>) 10:31, 6 June 2020 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The very first thing the box says is "This is a standard message to notify contributors about an administrative ruling in effect. It does not imply that there are any issues with your contributions to date." It absolutely, positively identifies itself as <i>not a scolding</i>. It's an alert to someone who's entered a particularly fraught topic, that's all. It's like worrying that someone is going to be scared off of driving at all by a "one-way" sign at the beginning of the one-way street, and asking what harm could come from placing it where it won't be visible until a driver has already covered the first 100 meters of the one-way section the wrong way. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Largoplazo" title="User:Largoplazo">Largoplazo</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Largoplazo" title="User talk:Largoplazo">talk</a>) 12:29, 6 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul><li>The notification is neutrally worded and contains information that any editor, new or old, wading into the topic should be aware of and I don't see this as a problem. In particular, it would be wrong not to let someone  wading into that particular controversial article that their edits will receive extra scrutiny. I'm sorry that the editor chose to not return but it doesn't follow that they should have been kept in the dark about the sanctions. <small>Technically, it is not correct that they dropped out after the warning because they appear to have made two edits before the warning (and the welcome!) and two edits after.</small>--<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RegentsPark" title="User:RegentsPark">regentspark</a> <small>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:RegentsPark" title="User talk:RegentsPark">comment</a>)</small> 14:10, 6 June 2020 (UTC)

<li>It's bitey in that it's a huge warning with incomprehensible text. Only someone who is already familiar with how Wikipedia works can even figure out what it's warning you about. I want to point out that the linked page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ACDS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ACDS">WP:ACDS</a> is completely unintelligible to a newbie, and that both of the terms "discretionary" and "sanction" just seem like arcane legalese. – <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:%C3%9Ejarkur" title="User:Þjarkur">Thjarkur</a></b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:%C3%9Ejarkur" title="User talk:Þjarkur">(talk)</a> 15:05, 6 June 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><p>(EC) I strongly disagree. It's not a warning. It's explicitly says it's not a warning. It's unfortunate that some people interpret it that way, but there's no real way we can avoid that. So the idea we should wait for misbehaviour goes completely against the purposes of alerts which is not to warn but to alert. This doesn't mean we should give alerts for every editor who makes one edit, IMO this generally isn't necessary although it will also depend on the topic. But you should guide yourself mostly by "is this editor editing enough in the area that they probably need to know?" </p><p>Which gets into my next point, new or old, editors need to take care when editing DS areas. In fact, DS areas tend to have admins more sensitive to problems even without using the DS process. In other words, behaviour which may earn at worst, strong rebuke may earn a block if it's happening in a DS area even if it's not through the DS process. It's good for editors to know quickly that they need to take special care, consider carefully what they are doing, listen, read our policies and guidelines, seek advice and be far less bold then we normally encourage editors to be. </p><p>Also, in some areas we get a lot of SPAs, or worse socks. While there are measures which could be put in place for specific articles e.g. long term ECP or even long term semi protection to reduce problems, these can be controversial themselves and they can't be applied to all articles. To give one specific example, consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#User:777_persona_777_and_Talk:Christopher_Langan#Intelligent_design" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#User:777 persona 777 and Talk:Christopher Langan#Intelligent design</a>. While okay, ECP could probably be applied to the article, I don't think it would be a good idea to do it to the talk page. But there are a lot of SPAs who keep popping up. Often these don't last very long. Giving them alerts quickly ensures that they are aware they need to take special care, and also that if necessary, they can be restricted quickly. AFAIK that hasn't even happened yet (there have been some blocks, but not under DS). Note that while me and others have alerted some of the editors, others haven't been alerted yet have disappeared, so I don't think there is even compelling evidence that they are being scared off. Frankly, in this particular case, I'm not sure if it's even harmful to scare off an editor who seems to only be here to push for or against the theories of some random person with a high IQ. To be clear, if these editors would be welcome to branch out into other areas, but most of them have only done a small amount in other areas, and even there it's often highly related. </p><p>Note that as I've said before, personally I greatly prefer it when editors alert someone who is on their "side" (for lack of a better word) because as I said, we can't stop people misinterpreting it as a warning so it's better if it's someone who may come across as "look I agree with you, but you need to take care when editing this area". However for a new editor it may not be so obvious anyway, plus I'd still prefer someone to alert. So provided editors are consistent in when they alert, I don't see any harm. </p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nil_Einne" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nil_Einne" title="User talk:Nil Einne">talk</a>) 15:20, 6 June 2020 (UTC)</p></dd></dl>
<ul><li>I also disagree strongly.  (1) As noted above, the alert notification is neutrally worded.  (2) Not allowing newbies to be alerted, while continuing to alert other editors, puts the newbies in a unwarranted protected class.  (3) Further, if the newbie has been misbehaving ina DS area, and continues to misbehave, admins would not be able to impose DS sanctions on them because they had not been alerted.<div class="paragraphbreak" style="margin-top:0.5em"></div>In my opinion, the proposal is ridiculous on its face. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Beyond_My_Ken" title="User:Beyond My Ken">Beyond My Ken</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Beyond_My_Ken" title="User talk:Beyond My Ken">talk</a>) 00:51, 7 June 2020 (UTC)</li>
<li>Let's face it: many articles under discretionary sanctions are haunted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOCKS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SOCKS">WP:SOCKS</a>. A sock will pretend to quit because an editor threatened him/her with discretionary sanctions, but in fact it is a circus acts merely done as trolling. Everyone who has access to a botnet could create lots of usernames in order to accuse an established editor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BITE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BITE">WP:BITE</a> and harassment. If one knows when an editor is online and which articles he/she edits, it is very easy to pull out this trick. Yup, botnet access is for sale on the dark web. Being honest means that the rules of the game are spelled out in advance. I do not see how hiding the knowledge of those rules from newbies would help them. E.g. a creationist POV-pusher, who only comes to Wikipedia in order to spew out creationist memes, will pretend that he/she did not know that that's against policies and guidelines. Someone has to tell them as it is: not in an offensive way, but in a clear and honest way. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tgeorgescu" title="User:Tgeorgescu">Tgeorgescu</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tgeorgescu" title="User talk:Tgeorgescu">talk</a>) 02:02, 7 June 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Whether they support or oppose, but let other participants in this thread see this comment by Tgeorgescu, "If one knows when an editor is online and which articles he/she edits, it is very easy to pull out this trick." There are many editors who can give discretionary sanction alert. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tgeorgescu" title="User:Tgeorgescu">User:Tgeorgescu</a> is saying that the new user was able to control who will post welcome message and discretionary snaction alert on his talk page.

<ul><li>As the named third party in all this, I'd better say something. From my vantage point both sides are using "vandalism" when actually it's a content dispute. The Churchill war ministry page had since 2013 and until a while back had the same section ("List of Ministers") as other ministries from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godolphin%E2%80%93Marlborough_ministry" title="Godolphin–Marlborough ministry">1707</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blair_ministry" title="Blair ministry">2007</a> - a list of the positions and the ministers who filled them. In  November 2019 the list of ministers <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Churchill_war_ministry&amp;oldid=927805078">was removed by No Great Shaker </a> as an "unnecessary list" and ended up in Draft space as it was uncited. SallyWho <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Churchill_war_ministry&amp;oldid=961273774%7Crestored">it to the Churchill war ministry article yesterday (7 June) </a>, No Great Shaker <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Churchill_war_ministry&amp;oldid=961277999">removed it again</a> on the grounds of still unsourced, and SallyWho <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Churchill_war_ministry&amp;oldid=961310926">put it back shortly after</a>. As I thought it belonged in the article, I decided to add to add some cites as that was the reason for previous removals. Since then No Great Shaker has made corrections and additions to the table. No Great Shaker then <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Churchill_war_ministry&amp;oldid=961437681">edited the table</a> to remove any Ministers already covered in the preceding section which lists the members of the cabinet in the ministry , renaming the disputed section "Ministers outside the War Cabinet". SallyWho reverted that change and after that it's a back and forth with No Great Shaker calling SallyWho's reverts "troll" and SallyWho calling No Great Shaker's reverts "vandalism".  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GraemeLeggett" title="User:GraemeLeggett">GraemeLeggett</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:GraemeLeggett" title="User talk:GraemeLeggett">talk</a>) 18:19, 8 June 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ymblanter" title="User:Ymblanter">Ymblanter</a>, I'll accept your decision on this but I think I would like you to adjudicate at the article talk page. I'll go there now and explain how I have been trying to improve the article. The account by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GraemeLeggett" title="User:GraemeLeggett">GraemeLeggett</a> above is a fair summary of what has happened. I may have overstepped the mark by suggesting that SallyWho is a probable block evader but it seems very odd to me that someone with a mere handful of edits should be so passionate about how another editor is trying to improve an article that has not, lets face it, been in very good shape. I cannot see how such an extreme reaction can suggest anything other than a vested interest in the article through past involvement. That's my opinion. Anyway, I'll say no more about that and will go to the article talk page to discuss the state of the article and how it can be improved.

<p>Back in February, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ronald_Reagan#Newly_released_audio" title="Talk:Ronald Reagan">closed an RfC at Talk:Ronald Reagan</a>. In my close, I found rough consensus to include a concise mention of some remarks, but suggested further discussion regarding the precise wording. Earlier today, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Springee" title="User:Springee">Springee</a> opened another RfC asking the same question of whether or not the remarks ought to be included. After I left a <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ronald_Reagan&amp;diff=961732582&amp;oldid=961732426&amp;diffmode=source">comment</a> indicating that I consider their formulation of the RfC to be inconsistent with my prior close, they replied raising several objections to the close. Could an admin look over my close from February, decide whether or not it is valid, and then help organize the follow-up discussion that is starting to take place? Thanks, <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 03:51, 10 June 2020 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I would like to note that I and another editor both found the previous closing to be problematic.  First, the non-admin closing conclusion of "rough consensus" was questionable based on numbers.  Sdkb said it came down to numbers and they felt it was 10:5 in favor.  As a personal rule of thumb I feel consensus by numbers is anything over 2/3rds so at best they are borderline.  However, there were 19 !votes; 9 yes, 5 no, 5 were "wait".  That means only 47% of the !votes were yes.  More importantly, the closing editor's neutrality on the matter suggests a strong POV for inclusion.  I will repeat that I don't think their POV is inherently problematic but upon closing the RfC the Sdkb became involved with other aspects of the Reagan biography page in a way that suggested a clear POV on what sort of material should be in the article.  They initiated a RfC here [<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ronald_Reagan#RfC">[22]</a>] .  After several months no editors had actually acted on the closed RfC.  Sdkb pinned the RfC so it wouldn't be archived[<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ronald_Reagan&amp;diff=941827829&amp;oldid=941185712">[23]</a>] and solicited other editors to make the changes they felt the RfC dictated[<a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ronald_Reagan&amp;diff=947582298&amp;oldid=947582068">[24]</a>].  Based on the evidence that the closing was not handled in a neutral fashion and the mathematically questionable determination of consensus I considered challenging the original closing.  However, since no editors had decided to act upon the RfC it seemed a moot issue.  Now that it is 9 months later and a number of editor's replies were "wait" I see no issue with opening a new RfC that can be closed by an uninvolved editor.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Springee" title="User:Springee">Springee</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Springee" title="User talk:Springee">talk</a>) 04:44, 10 June 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I have not expressed any opinion about the inclusion of the remarks, and I do not think it would be my role as closer to do so. I invited two editors I noticed working on the article a month or so after the close (I don't know the political tendencies of either) to participate in the follow-up discussion about the wording since that discussion wasn't really happening; that is different than "solicited other editors to make the changes they felt the RfC dictated". <span style="color:#AAA"><small>&#123;{u&#124;</small><span style="border-radius:9em;padding:0 5px;background:#088"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sdkb" title="User:Sdkb"><span style="color:#FFF"><b>Sdkb</b></span></a></span><small>}&#125;</small></span> <sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sdkb" title="User talk:Sdkb"><b>talk</b></a></sup> 06:03, 10 June 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I looked into this a bit more as I had always assumed this was a formal RfC.  It never was.  Rather it was an informal survey that simply died out.  That might explain why nothing happened between the end of discussions in October 2019 and the Sdkb's "closing" in February 2020.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Springee" title="User:Springee">Springee</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Springee" title="User talk:Springee">talk</a>) 17:00, 10 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I discussed with them on their talk page on what version of the article constitutes status quo ante. As I see things, the version with the pic in the lede is that version. After the pic was added to the lede, several months passed and, if I am not mistaken, some 30 edits were made on the article with nobody challenging that edit. Is not that counted as "silent consensus"? After "silent consensus", is not a new consensus needed to make a change? Those two questions are what I am not persuaded about in the RfC closure. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ktrimi991" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Ktrimi991">Ktrimi991</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ktrimi991" title="User talk:Ktrimi991">talk</a>) 16:35, 10 June 2020 (UTC)

The point I would like clarification about could probably be summarized this way: If I challenge an edit made 1 year ago, and after  discussion there is no consenus, then the version I support should stay as a pre-dispute one?

<dl><dd>"Common sense" can cause disputes rather than solve them in controversial Balkan topics. No wonder Balkan topics on Wikipedia have so many problems and conflicts. The rationale of that "common sense" implies that one can remove content from an article and they do not even need consensus because "contentious content" should not be on the article. I was aware of the fact that editors in general tend to support decisions such as RfC closures, but I expected some justification based on well-defined rules, not that kind of "common sense". It is no wonder then that Wiki has lost so many editors during the years. Anyways, I do not see any reason to further continue this discussion, as it has already become pointless. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ktrimi991" class="mw-redirect" title="User:Ktrimi991">Ktrimi991</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ktrimi991" title="User talk:Ktrimi991">talk</a>) 19:58, 10 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>After reading all the input on this discussion, I do sympathize with Ktrimi991.  The effect of the decision I made is to crystallize what Ktrimi991 feels is the wrong version of the article -- and I can see why, when I have sat the "stable version" such a long time in the past, this user might feel as if I've played a bit fast and loose with the rules.<div class="paragraphbreak" style="margin-top:0.5em"></div>My position is that encyclopaedia-writers are educators, and that puts us under a basic duty not to mislead people.  Properly analyzing sources is fundamental to what we do.  In this case, independent and normally-reliable sources like the CIA World Factbook do seem to use the figures on this 2011 census -- but there are other, also independent and normally-reliable, sources that describe it as wildly inaccurate.  We're dealing with research that's disputed, or even, suspect.  In those circumstances, I took the view that the last "stable" version was the one that doesn't include an infographic based on the disputed research, and my view on that was certainly coloured by the possibility that the infographic is wrong.<div class="paragraphbreak" style="margin-top:0.5em"></div>Please note that in doing so, I've backdated the last "stable" version <i>well over a year from the start of the RfC</i>.  In that respect my decision was unusual, so Ktrimi991's outrage is understandable.  We need to be fair, and although I'm grateful for all the "endorses" above, I do feel that some more careful, sober analysis from uninvolved editors is called for, and I'm completely open to being overturned if I was wrong.—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:S_Marshall" title="User:S Marshall"><b style="font-family: Verdana; color: Maroon;">S&#160;Marshall</b></a>&#160;<small><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:S_Marshall" title="User talk:S Marshall">T</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/S_Marshall" title="Special:Contributions/S Marshall">C</a></small> 00:57, 11 June 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:S_Marshall" title="User:S Marshall">S Marshall</a>:</span> I am very happy you reviewed the RfC. My major issue is not a pic in the lede of an article, as after all when one participates in a RfC is aware that their opinion might not "win", and that is just a pic that changes nothing. What I find disturbing is the way editors who edit difficult areas such as the Balkans are treated, and in what condition a good part of Wiki policies are. The major reason why topics such as the Balkans are a mess on Wiki is that the rules are not well-defined, have multiple interpretations, and the noticeboards that are supposed to help just leave the requests unanswered or give answers without citing any well-defined policy. It is the big picture that is a problem, not merely a single pic. Thanks again for reviewing the RfC, and hope we will have the opportunity to work together in other places on Wiki too.

<dl><dd>Would it be fair to say you're happy with this close review as-is, then? It's important that you feel you've had the chance to put your case and the decision has been reviewed in a fair manner.<div class="paragraphbreak" style="margin-top:0.5em"></div>The state of our policies and guidelines is poor and I once spent nearly a <i>year</i> fixing wording that implied the truth doesn't matter. And Wikipedian policies and guidelines are like scripture: somewhere in the labyrinthine maze of rules you can find support for any position. I know that's unsatisfactory.<div class="paragraphbreak" style="margin-top:0.5em"></div>But the flip side of that is that the rules aren't really worth revising, unless we can come up with a Turing-complete set of rules that can't be gamed and don't require editorial discretion. If we can't then every decision is a judgment call, so we'll be inconsistent and sometimes arbitrary.

<p>Good news! The vids were just restored to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7P3GAFCyfe5ZQHXoy5pkzsL1iEoPZO6J">a playlist</a> I can access, which means my vandalism is actually done. What's more, here is a big long list of socks you can block now since I won't be needing them, in numerical order (the number before each is not part of the name, just my way of organizing it in a Google Doc which was too much trouble to remove for the copy and paste, but the same number at the end of each username is):

<p>I have for a long time been following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAT:T2" class="mw-redirect" title="CAT:T2">CAT:T2</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAT:T3" class="mw-redirect" title="CAT:T3">CAT:T3</a> and have seen quite a lot of templates that would be more suitable to handled through TfD, redirection, moving the page to another namespace or speedily deleted under another criteria and am now considering a proposal to deprecate these criteria. In preparation for such a proposal I have been combing through the deletion log looking for templates deleted under these criteria during the last month and would like to see the content of these templates to help assessing how well the criteria are working. If some admin with a bit of spare time could help out by getting the last revision of each of the following pages and send them to me by email that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

<p>Hi. Some of you may have noticed that the log entries for adding user rights with expirations don't currently include the expiration (haven't for the last ~2 days) This is being investigate (<a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T255330" class="extiw" title="phab:T255330">phab:T255330</a>). In the meantime, I started a manual log of the missing expirations at <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/P11488" class="extiw" title="phab:P11488">phab:P11488</a> - it would be really helpful if those adding user rights with expirations could put in their log entries how long the rights are for, so that if at some point a maintenance script is written to fix the old log entries the correct data is available.

<p>Recently, I and my students have become victims of some serious harassment through email (I've already informed a number of admins and WMF about it). Anyway, the solution to harassment on talk pages has been to semi-protect our userpages and elevate students to auto-confirm status, which I did through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Event_coordinator" title="Wikipedia:Event coordinator">Wikipedia:Event coordinator</a> tool. But the solution to email harassment is a bit tougher. I did find that there is an option (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ENABLEEMAIL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ENABLEEMAIL">WP:ENABLEEMAIL</a>) to "Allow emails from brand-new users", which when disabled, requires autoconfirmed right to email a given user. It seems like a great solution to harassment by email (the person harassing us is creating a brand new account for each email, as the  old one gets blocked by CU quickly after). However, that option is disabled by default. And while I could auto-confirm my students and admins did semi-protect their talk pages (thanks), right now I don't think either of those flags (or any flags at all?) would allow us to enable the function of 'Allow emails from brand-new users' for another account. And this is a gap in our anti-vandal/harassment toolkit, as while of course I can make a class announcement / video telling my students to enable this option to protect their accounts, some will miss it, and it may be days before they do so. As such, I think it may be worth discussing if admins and/or event coordinators shouldn't be granted the power to enable this option for other accounts, in cases of harassment by email. Through to make it a bit more complicated still, they should be able to do it on a global level through global preferences, since any smart vandal/harasser can simply shrug and send an email through Commons, wikibooks or Urdu Wikipedia instead. But the fact remains that right now we may be somewhat impotent when dealing with email harassment, but the tools to deal with this exist, just need to be activated and given to the admins. Another option would be to enable this feature by default for all projects, because how often does a brand new account needs to be emailed by another brand new account? But as with any global changes, the latter option is probably more trouble than it is worth it (and of course it probably would need to be discussed on meta not here), even through it wouldn't really affect anything or anyone of significance.

<dl><dd>From taking a closer look. The subpages all appear to be lists either of wikidata or wikipedia articles.

<p>Hi, if it helps, I am one of the many people that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GerardM" title="User:GerardM">GerardM</a> has worked with. I was also there right at the start of this process. I am a wiki newbie, just like hundreds others that GerardM has brought to contribute (mostly to wikidata) over the last months (from Bangladesh to Panama). I just tried to access the project page and couldn't find it anymore. The page is basically the starting point for more than 50 organizations of professors (young scientists that are part of young national academies of science as well as their alumni) that are being mapped as part of a wikidata project. See here for more information: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://globalyoungacademy.net/national-young-academies/">https://globalyoungacademy.net/national-young-academies/</a>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:PPEscientist" title="User:PPEscientist">PPEscientist</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:PPEscientist" title="User talk:PPEscientist">talk</a>) 21:30, 14 June 2020 (UTC)

<dd>Hi PPEscientist, I feel you may have been misled or giving incorrect information as to the basic point of wikipedia, so I will start from there. English Wikipedia's (ENWP) purpose is to create an encyclopedia. Much as Wikimedia Commons (Commons) is to create a repository of free media, and Wikidata is to create a shared resource of data to use in multiple language wiki's (altho this may have changed in scope, as Wikidata is doing its own thing). ENWP has a number of different spaces for different purposes. Article space is where we store the articles for the readers. Userspace is where editors have their user and talk pages where collaboration/communication to improve articles takes place. Project space (usually denoted by a WP:&lt;title&gt;) is where all the policies, guidelines, noticeboards, documentation for the running of the encyclopedia sit. Its also where we have our Wikiprojects. Wikiprojects are groups of editors that come together to improve a group of articles within their projects scope. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MILHIST" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MILHIST">WP:MILHIST</a> focuses on military subjects, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WIRED" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WIRED">WP:WIRED</a> seeks to improve the coverage of articles involving women, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDICINE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MEDICINE">WP:MEDICINE</a> seeks to improve content on medical articles. The key point here is they are all intended to improve our article content for readers. From your description above, and reading the website you posted, what you describe is something that is more of a project, but it is more of a data gathering/tracking exercise, that doesnt have any direct (or indirect that I can tell) goal/purpose of improving the encyclopedia. This isnt to say its not something that should be done, just that it does not appear to be something that is within our scope for Wikipedia. Hence the rather direct questions to GerardM and from DMacks above. Wikidata being a data collecting project is probably more a good fit for your purpose than wikipedia, and as (from looking at a lot of the pages created by GerardM) a lot of the information is already stored there, likely in scope for that project. Another alternative would be starting your own dedicated wiki. The references to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTWEBHOST" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTWEBHOST">WP:NOTWEBHOST</a> are linking the relevant policy/guideline that lays out that we are not an indiscriminate web host for the hosting of material. We host stuff that is directly (or indirectly) intended to improve the encyclopedia. Data/Tracking does not really fall within that. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Only_in_death" title="User:Only in death">Only in death does duty end</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Only_in_death" title="User talk:Only in death">talk</a>) 09:47, 15 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>It strikes me that you first abuse your own procedures and then ask questions. In the information provided by Robert, you find a link to its website. It shows other organisations and, the majority of them have their own websites as well, they are linked in the information as provided. They are fairly active, they list their members and inform about their accomplishments. Largely this information is used as references for the people involved. They have their own scientific programs, one of them informs about Covid19. These are not specifically linked in our data. Where these papers have a DOI they are included in Wikidata through the normal ingestion methods. This gets reflected in the relevant Scholias.
</p><p>The ultimate outcome is "share in the sum of all knowledge", a bit like what we do as a movement. Each Listeria lists shows information that is particular for what it is about. As time goes by, more people, more papers are included and as a consequence it becomes no longer viable to just utter "not notable" because the information about people, awards, organisations is directly available and as up to date as we have it. This data will be correct and not suffer from the false friends you find in Wikipedia lists and links.
</p><p>In Listeria lists and, you know that, it is clearly known what list items have a local Wikipedia article. It follows that as lists are followed, it is easy to check on the quality of articles and provide additional information. One such is that every year new recipients happen to awards. As you may know, there is a Scholia template and it is used on many Wikipedia articles providing additional, up to date information.
</p><p>For me personally it is again obvious that you do not know what is in front of you. Your procedures are open for abuse as is clearly demonstrated and the only way to address this is to contest this deletion. Given that there was an ongoing real time discussion your procedures are abusive and do not reflect what Wikimedia stands for. I have been an admin for many years and I am glad those days are done. I do not need to reflect on this collective behaviour.
</p><p>I doubt that there is room to discuss ways that will improve Wikipedia quality by 4 to 6% in its lists and wiki links. Thanks, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GerardM" title="User:GerardM">GerardM</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:GerardM" title="User talk:GerardM">talk</a>) 05:56, 15 June 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Instead of rants which don't answer any questions, perhaps you can't explain why this wasn't done either in your own user space, or in project space (or on Wikidata), but on the page of a non-existant "user", actually a front for a group (or a shared account), which has been blocked since long. I notice that you already have <b>640 userspace subpages</b><a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0&amp;ns2=1&amp;search=prefix%3AUser%3AGerardM%2F&amp;advancedSearch-current={}">[25]</a>, which is more than the number of mainspace edits you made over the past 5 years. Your activity on user talk, Wikipedia, and Wikipedia talk space are minimal. So what exactly are all these pages (in your user space, and in the userspace under discussion here) <i>actually</i> doing for the improvement of enwiki? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fram" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Fram" title="User talk:Fram">talk</a>) 07:06, 15 June 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>This project was not my initiative but something that I consider important. Otherwise it would be a project with a subpage of my userprofile. At the start a name for a profile was chosen that reflects what the project is about. The user was blocked and this matters little as long as the page is available.
</p><p>Yes, I have a large number of subpages and they all reflect projects I work on. On my profile page you find what they are about. The problem that I face is that Wikipedia does not have the quality in its information that we seek. In these Listeria lists I provide consolidated data from several Wikipedias about these subjects. Often a Wikipedia is superior in a given domain, I use tooling and manual edits to include the data in Wikidata. These Listeria lists are shared with other Wikipedias. This enables comparison and improvement on the data local and in Wikidata. 
</p><p>Given that we are working in a Wiki way, it allows for autonomous growth. Both local changes and changes from data are reflected in my watchlist. In this way these Listeria lists provide an excellent tool to learn about particular subject matter.

<dl><dd>None of that actually seems to be about improving Wikipedia articles however. And from your description this looks like a project that should be on wikidata. Also your lists are in userspace and so won't be visible in any real fashion for readers to learn from, and they can't exist for the most part in article space as they would be subject to the rules around lists and bots. As well as other editors. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Only_in_death" title="User:Only in death">Only in death does duty end</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Only_in_death" title="User talk:Only in death">talk</a>) 11:21, 15 June 2020 (UTC)

In that request, however, the proposer mischaracterized the request as “due to the highly controversial nature of the topic and multiple inconclusive past RfCs.” That is indicative of the confusion I’ve described. It is not controversial (only a small minority of editors object); in the current RfC, all votes were for including candidates who had earned a delegate; the one material RfC was clearly decided but the result was ignored; the others were distractions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Humanengr" title="User:Humanengr">Humanengr</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Humanengr" title="User talk:Humanengr">talk</a>) 09:11, 15 June 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>What a pain, I wonder if there is a way to fix the filter.  Unfortunately the error message doesn't identify what filter it is that blocked the edit, since I wanted to check how often the filter actually triggers, though chances are it's one filter for multiple patterns.  shop.eu spamming is probably rare enough that it can be handled by xlinkbot instead of a filter.  Anyway I'll see about whitelisting.

<p>I'm sure there are more diffs from this incident should anyone else want to find them.
</p><p>Sashi has been warned multiple times, at AE, in unblock requests, and even in his initial unblock that he is wearing the patience of the community thin. He has been subject to 8 sanctions and/or blocks since his unblock, multiple ones based on inability to interact well with others, a battleground mentality, or harassment. He is now using admin accountabliity as an excuse to harass an individual who is trying to hold <i>him</i> accountable for his actions. Enough is enough.
</p><p>Based on the above actions, which demonstrate a long-term inability to interact with others on this project, I am proposing the following:

<li><b>Support</b> The pattern of behavior after the 2018 unblock shows that we've moved beyond second or third chances. Reading through the 2018 unblock discussion, the community extended a healthy amount of AGF: while the behavior in pursuing a sockpuppet was concerning, we assumed good faith particularly because Sashi was ultimately correct about the editor. Since then, the behavior that led to that block has not improved. Restrictions for incivility, multiple blocks for battleground behavior, multiple topic bans, a block for violating one of those topic bans---we have long since reached the point where the benefits outweigh the costs of having to manage these issues. This would be my position without considering the recent hounding of El_C, and when that behavior is considered, it simply reinforces my concern. Those opposed to unblocking in 2018 frequently pointed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTTHEM" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTTHEM">WP:NOTTHEM</a> saying that the unblock request focused on others rather than the behavior that led to the block. In these engagements with El_C I see the same behavior where SashiRolls seems to be trying to impugn El_C in order to get unblocked rather than grapple with their own behavior. The past year and a half do not give me confidence that their behavior will improve in the near future, and until it does, we should not continue to waste our time on this treadmill. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">— <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wugapodes" title="User:Wugapodes">Wug·</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Wugapodes" title="User talk:Wugapodes">a·po·des</a>​</span> 00:31, 16 June 2020 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> I was in favor of unblocking Sashi Rolls when I commented at 02:00, 29 October 2018, and within three days, I was dismayed to see this editor engage in the very behavior that they had been warned against by so many other editors. After reading the evidence above, I have concluded that Sashi Rolls has core personality traits that makes productive, collaborative participation in this encyclopedia impossible. Their recent harassment of El_C is the straw that broke my back. Thanks to TonyBallioni for doing the work to assemble the evidence. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328"><b style="color:#070">Cullen</b><sup style="color:#707">328</sup></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cullen328" title="User talk:Cullen328"><span style="color:#00F"><i>Let's discuss it</i></span></a> 03:19, 16 June 2020 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b>. The point of lesser sanctions like IBANs/TBANs/partial blocks etc is to reduce disruption. There are cases where people get heated up when editing a particular topic area, or interacting with a certain person, but having been sanctioned, are able to remain reasonable when editing elsewhere. Unfortunately, it's obvious from the number of different sanctions that have been enacted on Sashi since the 2018 unblock that this is simply not the case for them. When removed from one area, they become heated in another, and another, and another. It seems clear to me that they are not suited for working on the kind of loosely-structured collaborative project that is Wikipedia, and that we have given them enough chances to prove otherwise. &#9824;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Premeditated_Chaos" title="User:Premeditated Chaos">PMC</a>&#9824; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Premeditated_Chaos" title="User talk:Premeditated Chaos">(talk)</a> 04:15, 16 June 2020 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b>: Sashi just <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=962814548">edited my initial post</a> changing my words about his behaviour to suit him, and referring to it as a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching" title="Lynching">lynching</a>”. This is worth adding to the record here, as it demonstrates why this site ban is needed. This is not someone who is compatible with a collaborative project. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TonyBallioni" title="User:TonyBallioni">TonyBallioni</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TonyBallioni" title="User talk:TonyBallioni">talk</a>) 05:36, 16 June 2020 (UTC)
<ul><li>This shocking display of disruption and clumsy attempt at deception is additional rock solid evidence that Sashi Rolls must be site banned from this encyclopedia. Comparing a discussion about whether a person should be allowed to participate on a private website with an extrajudicial murder by a violent mob is reprehensible and grotesque. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328"><b style="color:#070">Cullen</b><sup style="color:#707">328</sup></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Cullen328" title="User talk:Cullen328"><span style="color:#00F"><i>Let's discuss it</i></span></a> 05:56, 16 June 2020 (UTC)
<ul><li><b>Comment</b> I highly suggest editors look at the diff. Aside from the edit summary describing this report as a “lynching”, it’s basically multiple swipes at various editors and administrators. I also suggest that interested editors look at the link for the AP topic ban and especially, the diff to the violation of said restriction. Honestly, his conduct in both areas seemed to me evidently disruptive and dismissive, but nor was it a particularly great look for some of the editors defending that latter page. A lot of this seems pretty petty. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Symmachus_Auxiliarus" title="User:Symmachus Auxiliarus">Symmachus Auxiliarus</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Symmachus_Auxiliarus" title="User talk:Symmachus Auxiliarus">talk</a>) 07:21, 16 June 2020 (UTC)</li></ul>

In fact, it was done at AE as a non-AE block for the sole purpose of making it easier for him to appeal once he realized it was his disruptive nature that was the problem.

</p><p>Dear Robin,
Sub:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Malabar_Nasrani" class="mw-redirect" title="Syrian Malabar Nasrani">Syrian Malabar Nasrani</a>
The interpretation given to Mar Thomma Sleeba is arbitrary. The citation given for the dubious interpretation is related to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menorah" class="mw-disambig" title="Menorah">Menorah</a>, a Jewish candelabra only. I'm quoting the cited Bible Verses below:
</p>
<ul><li>31 And you must make a lampstand of pure gold. Of hammered work the lampstand is to be made. Its base, its branches, its cups, its knobs and its blossoms are to proceed out from it. 32 And six branches are running out from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from its one side and three branches of the lampstand from its other side. 33 Three cups shaped like flowers of almond are on the one set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating, and three cups shaped like flowers of almond on the other set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating. This is the way it is with the six branches running out from the lampstand. 34 And on the lampstand are four cups shaped like flowers of almond, with its knobs and its blossoms alternating. 35 And the knob under two branches is out of it and the knob under the two other branches is out of it and the knob under two more branches is out of it, for the six branches running out from the lampstand. 36 Their knobs and their branches are to proceed out from it. All of it is one piece of hammered work, of pure gold. 37 And you must make seven lamps for it; and the lamps must be lit up, and they must shine upon the area in front of it. 38 And its snuffers and its fire holders are of pure gold. 39 Of a talent of pure gold he should make it with all these utensils of it. 40 And see that you make them after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.</li></ul>
<p>Assuming similarity in interpretation and design of Menorah to Marthoma Sleeba without proper reference is clear violation of wikipedia policies. Moreover nowhere in The Holy Bible or Jewish Torah, any interpretation has been assigned to Menorah. The given interpretation in this article suggests, the the central shaft symbolizing Jesus and six other branches symbolizing God the Father. But in all relevant references including Wikipedia Page:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menorah" class="mw-disambig" title="Menorah">Menorah</a>, the central branch symbolizes God the Father. Also the contented portion is not supported by any other references which suggest the given interpretation. Since it's a sensitive and contentious issue, the portion could be removed unless supported by reliable and verifiable sources.

<p>Interpretations could be included, but here the issue is different. Buddha-related interpretation has been taken from verifiable source, while the same misses for Jewish interpretation. In Jewish tradition, primary interpretation for Menorah is the symbolism of seven planets and the secondary one is a little similar to the given one. Moreover, no historians seems to support the link between menorah and Mar Thomma Sleeba. Menorah with a cross is totally different in design and appearance vis-s-vis Mar Thomma Sleeba. Whatever be, kindly cite the source of Jewish interpretation if there are any? --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ashleypt" title="User:Ashleypt">Ashleypt</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ashleypt" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Ashleypt">talk</a>) 08:50, 10 October 2011 (UTC)

Some descriptions added to explain the cultural identity of Syrian Christians with necessary citation. One sentence unrelated to the topic has been shifted under the heading "Nazrani". A possibility for the title "Mappila" as proposed by some historians has been added under "nazrani"

<p>Dear Robin Klein,
</p><p>I apologize for accusing you like that, but he word, Jew or Jewish has been used 43 times in the document and many times in controversial way. I have't tried to modify any of those disputable contents, but anybody who flick through the article could easily understand the undue preference given to Jewish section of the early Christians in Kerala. You may not be directly responsible for such a  partisan version of the document. But please be expeditious to enhance it's neutrality.

<p>Dear Robin Klein,
I think a brief description about the ethnic groups in native people who were evangelized by St.Thomas is not against wikipedia policy or standards. Dravidian or Aryan is just an ethnic group as Semitic.You prefer to specify Semitic and opposes Aryan/Dravidian. Similarly Jew is a sub group in Semitic Race and Brahmin is a sub group in Aryan race. That's why giving preference to Jews over other ethinic sub-groups is considered partisan. Anyway, I'm waiting for a neutral opinion on it.

<p>Hi Robin:
</p><p>Thanks for replying. A couple of quick comments. I refer to Bernard Sergent, who is a renouned anthropologist. He is a very objective author and does not talk about races in terms of "superior" or "inferior", like many "scholars" who discourse the "yellow-skinned man" and the "dark skinned man".  Let me quote some of his findings wrt Dravidians. 
</p><p>a) He claims that the Dravidians, dark skinned individuals, emmigrated from from the Sahel belt in what now comprises the Sudan and Senegal and brought with them the Dravidian Languages (or what we refer to as Proto-Dravidian). So we are talking in terms of tribes from Africa, that belong to an established, definate racial pattern, emmigrating to South Asia, and not differing small groups that later came together and exchanged genes. Besides, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, etc are highly evolved, even Sanskritized (Kannada, Telugu), Dravidian tongues are relatively new. So to say that "South Indians are bound together by the Dravidian languages of Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam..." is incorrect since a)They were already  bound together by race when they emmigrated. In fact, it was the birth of distinct languages that culturally separated these peoples, as was the case with Kannada and Tamil and b) Tamil is the oldest one of these languages and dates back to <i>only</i> 250 BC, Kannada to 450 AD, Telugu to 650 AD and Malayalam to 900 AD, and so on, whereas systemized Dravidian immigration into India dates back to tens of thousands of years. My ultimate point here being that it is <b>not</b> language, but race that identifies these people!
</p><p>While your quoting Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza might definately be valid, I doubt that he specifically analyzed the migratory and linguistic patterns of the Dravidian race. He might have been talking in general terms, as opposed to constructing a definative, all encompassing theory.
</p><p>b) I agree that it is incorrect to refer to all south Indians as Dravidians. The Syrians, Jews, etc did come to the Malabar coast, but I find it hard to believe that these people did not "exchange genes" with the locals. This means that there is definately a Dravidian majority in the region. Besides, there is no "pure" Aryan or Dravidian in India anymore. Sergent also points to a third, "brown" race, the Veddas that inhabited much of India (what he calls "people of the land", since they were not immigrants). But if we talk in terms of proportions, I think we are likely to find a greater proportion of Dravidian genes in South India than any other race. Sergent's research points to a majority Vedda-Dravidian ancestory to south Indians.
</p><p>c) As far as matriarchal families. Being a south Indian and having travelled extensively in south India, I have not encountered matriarchal families at all, especially among the Proto-Tamil-Kannada cultural offshoot. These societies are <b>completely</b> patriarchal. The Nairs that you refer to are the <b>only</b> practicing <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.keralalink.com/keralalink/html/people___lifestyle.html">matriarchal society in Kerala</a>. And Kerala is the natural candidate for a matriarchal society, being the only state/region with a majority female population. The Nairs are also one of the only 2 practicing matriarchal families in all of India, let alone south India (the Bunts of Uttara Kanara being the other). Therefore it is very incorrect to generalize and refer to South Indian family system as matriarchal, since the region is overwhelmingly patriarchal! Thanks.

<p>Hi Robin:
</p><p>The general idea is that Dravidians are not so much connected by language as they are by a common race and ancestory. The genesis of language comes out of social organization of a race or a bunch of races. So I think more than languages, it is the <b>race</b> that bindes Dravidians. I would like to either leave out the sentence that ties Dravidians to language, <i>or atleast</i> make it auxillary to a discussion on a common racial binding.  Thanks.

<p>Hi Robin,
I saw that your contribution to the slavery artcile has unfortunately been deleted <a class="external autonumber" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Slavery&amp;diff=4881627&amp;oldid=4848521">[1]</a>. In my opinion it is a worthy contribution to the article, but in that form it was unacceptable because it describes a view that would be extremely controversial in the US as fact. Do you have any links to articles in which this view has been expressed in this manner? It could then be added in the form "some have compared modern prison labour to slavery" etc. It would also be good if one included information about other countries with similar practices, such as China for example, so that it looks less like the usual US bashing. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pir" title="User:Pir">pir</a> 10:40, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)

<p>Mr. Klein, 
</p><p>I am Robert Gupta, and I would like to borrow some of your time to briefly discuss with you your edit of my name from the "child prodigies" list. Firstly, if something were to be posted about me, I would appreciate notice of that information being distributed on the internet. I believe that this is simply common courtesy. Secondly, about the Juilliard matter: If my age was the reason you removed my name from the list, then I believe that you are quite incorrect, sir, for I did not enter Juilliard at 14, but at 7. I graduated from Juilliard at 14, because I started my Undergraduate studies at that age. Personally, I don't think I'm a prodigy, and I have no concern or desire to be on your "list" whatsoever. I simply would appreciate if the information posted about me on the internet is accurate, and I despise the fact that you ignorantly modified information about a certain person without having the full knowledge of that person's background. I don't speak for myself, as, again, I don't care to be on your list. However, I do express my concern about your cursory review and investigation of my information on the behalf of other true prodigies, or even on the behalf of the other subjects for which you so admirably show enthusiasm for. Perhaps it would be wise to truly understand one's background and full training before modifying their information. Also, for the person who originally posted my information, it would also be prudent for you to do your research as well: this is not entirely Mr. Klein's fault, but the fault of the person who originally posted my information. I am, once again, not concerned about my information, but I am concerned about the lack of review and investigation for subjects more important to the societal benefit than my musical training. In conclusion, if you wish to edit information about a certain person, please have the courtesy to sincerely investigate and accurately modify that person's information, with the said person's consent. 
</p><p>Thank you, 
Robert V. Gupta

<p><b>To Robert Gupta</b>
</p><p>Dear Mr. Robert Gupta,
</p><p>when I edited the information posted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jondel" title="User:Jondel">User:Jondel</a> I went by the information provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jondel" title="User:Jondel">User:Jondel</a> on 3rd of august 2004.  Please see the history of the page on child prodigy. there are lakhs of editors, working for/on the wikipedia. And one assumes that the information posted by the previous author is accurate. Which in many cases it is. As for Julliard school I was only refering to the fact that it is full of amazing kids like you, who play extra ordinary music at young age. It would be an unending task and probably pointless task to list all their name on this list. 
</p><p>The names on this list are those of prodigies who went on to shine far longer into their adulthood. I hope you will be one of them. I hope you will live up to your PRODIGIOUS talent and shine even better in adulthood. When that happens (in a few years) I would be the first one to add your name on this list. 
</p><p>Besides I read about you for the first time over 6 years. I tried my best to get a ticket to your performance, which I believed included a composition by sarasate. But then I was unable to get a ticket. However a fine friend of mine managed to attend your performance (6 years ago). She told a lot about your performance and that you have also taken training under Itzakh perlmann.
</p><p>I have not put any inaccurate information about you on the net / wikipedia. I only edited on the information provided by the previous editor on 3rd of august 2004. However it seems that my edit has caused hurt to you. And that thought of having hurt such a promising musician is itself hurting to me. I sincerely apologize for this. However I sould say that I was only editing information provided by the previous editor. It would be virtually impossible to scrutinize the info given by every writer on the wikipedia. 
</p><p>As for the list on child prodigy. The tradition has always been to write names of those prodigies who grew even stronger as the grew up. Because unfortunately the list (if one was to make) of those who had prodigious talent and faded away is even longer and extremely painful. Hence it is only after a person has matured that his/her name is added to the list of child prodigy. the concern here is for parents who drive their kids to any extent to make PRODIGIES out of kids in the form of trophies. and yes such parents are not rare. It is therefor important to wait and see the maturation of a child prodigy into an adult virtuoso. I am sure you woud be a fascinating virtuoso violinsit into your adulthood. which in a way you already are. But only that the experiences of Nigel Kennedy and the like makes one wary of such titles. these titles could itself become a burden on other kids who are unable to match up to those who are prodigious. 
</p><p>I hope you wont remember my name in disdain but only with pleasant thought. It love music and I respect musicians and in no way would I ever hurt them. I hope you would be able to use you skills in music for studies on music cognition. I know you are in Yale doing medicine. So I would not be surprised to see your paper in one of the journals of the cognitive sciences, dealing with music cognition.
</p><p>your admirer Robin.

</p><p>Dear Sir, 
</p><p>I am in no way hurt by your edit, and I thank you for your kind words. I was simply upset to see  some of my information misrepresented on the internet (going to Juilliard at 14). Please understand that I mean you every good wish, and I hold no hard feelings. In my honest opinion, I am not a prodigy. In fact, the only violinist, in my eye, who was a true child prodigy was Michael Rabin. For, from a musician's perspective, a child prodigy is one who shows not only great promise and talent as a youngster, but also who has fulfilled and exploited that talent at a very young age, to the extent that would make even a conservatory-trained graduate student blush. Again, I appreciate your intent, and I sincerely apologize if I have, in any way, hurt you. I am currently at Yale, but not studying medicine. I am starting my Master's, and hope to apply to Med school after the completion of the aforementioned degree. I am very, very appreciative of your interest in music, and I hope that researchers, historians, and compilers of knowledge (such as you Wikipedians) may be able to appreciate and consider music from all angles, as I wish to study music from the Neurobiological one. I truly believe that music, as one of the most moral and beautiful arts, will allow us to uncover the secrets of our being, and will inspire us to realize our humanity. 
</p><p>Truly yours, 
Robert

Hi Robin:
</p><p>Thanks for the mail. I was really not attempting to discuss the etymological differences between Karnataka and carnatic. Rather those sentences are really just caveats to your discussion of the Carnatic region, and as you rightly point out, people do get confused between the name of a region emanating from an ancient music artform and the name of a modern state that first appeared only in 1950.

<p>Hi Robin:
</p><p>We did have some sort of order in the privious edit. They were all arranged in terms of size of the state, and the number of speakers for the languages. But I guess one order is as good as the other, so I'll rv it back to that person's edit soon. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AreJay" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 20:32, 18 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<p>Hi, I notice that you are adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Universities" title="Category:Universities">Category:Universities</a> to a lot of pages. The problem is that there is already a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Universities_and_colleges" title="Category:Universities and colleges">Category:Universities and colleges</a> which is largely a double of that category. It also creates some other problems such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Academia" title="Category:Academia">Category:Academia</a> now being a subcategory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Universities" title="Category:Universities">Category:Universities</a>, while both the category and the article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academia" class="mw-redirect" title="Academia">Academia</a> actually encompass a larger field, including academies of sciences, other learned societies and other things in the same general field (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Universities_and_colleges" title="Category:Universities and colleges">Category:Universities and colleges</a> is actually an indirect subcategory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Academia" title="Category:Academia">Category:Academia</a> via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Academic_institutions" title="Category:Academic institutions">Category:Academic institutions</a>). 
</p><p>I think the content of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Universities" title="Category:Universities">Category:Universities</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Universities_and_colleges" title="Category:Universities and colleges">Category:Universities and colleges</a> should rather be merged under one category, and preferrably the latter, as it has a more inclusive name.

</p><p>and i didn't put up the original article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Baselius_Paulos_II&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Baselius Paulos II (page does not exist)">Baselius Paulos II</a>. i only added a few links and tried to make it more readable. 
</p><p>you seem to be bend on reverting any change i make. come on, editors can take more effort or wikipedia is going to loose a few contributors.

<p>Hi Robin! It sure feels like I've come full circle during my time here in Wikipedia! You were <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:AreJay/Archive_1">the first Wikipedian</a> that I had the opportunity to collaborate with back in 04 and here we are again! By the way, I do hope that you are not upset with some of the recent edits in the article. I hold your viewpoint and contributions to the article with the highest regard. Perhaps I was a little hasty in saying that we should stick to representing facts &#8212; merely citing facts makes for pretty dull reading. I am okay with including the various opinions of authors, provided that we specify something along the lines of "One author asserts that the South Indian worldview is...". 
</p><p>It is important to distinguish fact from opinon, in my view, because generalizing a region as diverse as South India without a pre-qualifier stating "this is an author's opinon" will invite needless POV warriors who will take exception to the information presented. As you probably already know, the dynamics of South India is riddled with regionalistic tussles. Like I say, I hold your contributions in the highest regard, please continue to contribute to the article. Thanks! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AreJay" title="User:AreJay">AreJay</a> 00:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hi! I must clarify. I did NOT mean negative when I told "Wow! That's great!..." etc. Perhaps it was my language that made you think I was being sarcastic.

<dd>So now I am reverting back to the sub-sectioned culture structure. Let's build it up that way. I REALLY liked the idea I tell you. And please, I am  not a serious kind of guy, take my words as lightly as possible, and usually I speak in direct manner, so , I emphasize, I was really meaning that it was a good model to follow. I will be waiting for your reply. Thanks.Regards. --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dwaipayanc" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 05:28, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hi! Why shouldn't I edit? These things always happen..! Let's see what others say regarding the way the article should be oriented. I support your view, especially the fact that the article might emerge as one of the firsts of its kind! However, I do not support blindly. I mean, even if the subsectioned "culture" is retained, at places, it is too repetitive. Needs copyedit. Bye.

<p>Hi! Yes, I already saw your comments in the talk page. But I differ in one point. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India" title="South India">South India</a> is not, after all, all about the culture. "Politics", "Regions" are as important. Plus, the aericle has to be written in a summary form, with daughter articles as necessary. so I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Indian_culture" title="South Indian culture">South Indian culture</a> should be retained, with a possibility that in future sections can be hugely expanded. Whereas in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India" title="South India">South India</a>, still I think culture should be written in a rather summary form. At present, it <i>is</i> in a summary form. So no need to summarise further, rather expansion is needed at places. However, there are a lot of information on the culture which may be added in future, and if adding a flurry of info then "de-summarise" culture section, the info may be easily added to the duaghter article of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Indian_culture" title="South Indian culture">South Indian culture</a>. At present, however, I admit that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Indian_culture" title="South Indian culture">South Indian culture</a> has become redundant, with it being almost a copy of the culture section!--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dwaipayanc" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayanc</a> 05:55, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hello, the 1 week period for improving the article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India" title="South India">South India</a> is over. The changes brought about by the contributions of so many, including yours, is amazing. What do you feel about the general ethos  of the article?

<p>Hi, you may have noticed I did some tweaking to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_school" title="Boarding school">Boarding school</a> article a few days ago and as part of this, I removed some content that you added. I guess you understood why I did so, because your reintroduction of this content is *much* more encyclopedic and better placed within the article; the citations are also a big improvement and you've kept me happy here. This is a bit of a long-winded way of saying well done&#160;:) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:TJDay&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:TJDay (page does not exist)">T.

<p>Hi Robin,
</p><p>Yes, the distinction is important, but I don't think we need the list of names of "analytic" philosophers in a continental philosophy intro.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy" title="Analytic philosophy">analytic philosophy</a> article doesn't make reference to continental philosophy or its philosophers in anglophone countries in its opening paragraphs.  Anyways, both articles need fixing up, feel free to fill in the stubs.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Poor_Yorick" title="User:Poor Yorick">Poor Yorick</a> 23:32, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hey! Thanks for getting back so soon. We seem to differ on how Mappila/Mapilla is spelt. My references and the current Wikipedia entry for Mappila/Mapilla point to Mappila. Perhaps you should create a Mapilla page and redirect it to Mappila. Or do you think changing all Mapillas to Mappilas would be simpler? Also, should we put in a brief stub in the Mappila page to point out the existence of the Nasrani Mappila term? Just wondering.

<p>Hello, Robin klein. Sorry, I have to undo your edits at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Selected_anniversaries/May_23" title="Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/May 23">Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/May 23</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar" title="Simón Bolívar">Simón Bolívar</a> is currently scheduled to be featured on Sept.7th (the height of his career), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_Agreement" class="mw-redirect" title="Belfast Agreement">Belfast Agreement</a> on Apr.10th (day of signing, which gave the nickname "Good Friday Agreement"). We are supposed to avoid repeat-featuring the same wikiarticles, so I removed them. Yes, it's okay to move things around, but in the case of the Good Friday Agreement, there isn't a replacement readily available for the Apr.10th template. Too bad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9rida,_M%C3%A9rida" title="Mérida, Mérida">Mérida, Mérida</a> is a tad stubby and doesn't mention the date, otherwise we can keep the event on May23rd and feature this page instead of Bolívar's. I almost removed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" title="Kyoto Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a>, too, 'coz IMHO, it's better to feature this article on either Feb.16th or Dec.11th. I may do this for 2007.
</p><p>Thank you for your interests in editing Selected Anniversaries templates. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Selected_anniversaries/June" title="Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/June">June templates</a> need help. I can't do much as I'm too busy in "real life". Please feel free to work on those (or any other Sel. Anniv. templates) if you like. Please keep in mind to diversify (in topics, time periods and geographical locations), avoid stubs, problem pages (tagged with {NPOV} etc.) and recent TFAs, and avoid repeats.

<p>Hi there, I am writing you because you were one of the contributors to the discussion last year about moving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">Classical music</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music" class="mw-redirect" title="European classical music">European classical music</a>.  Well, the decision to do that did not have great effects - it has created a lot of confusion.  Specifically, people editing articles that contain references are almost exclusively using the link <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">classical music</a>, which of course leads to a disambig page.  They literally <b>always</b> mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music" class="mw-redirect" title="European classical music">European classical music</a> in their context.  So, it is creating a nightmare for us folks at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DPL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DPL">Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links</a>, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">Classical music</a> remains the number one offender as far as the number of articles that link to a disambig page.  Which shouldn't happen. I think the crux of the issue is that English-language editors think "classical music" and they know what they mean - and we are trying to tell them that they really mean something else.
</p><p>(Deep breath) So, we need to try to solve this issue. My inclination is to move <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music" class="mw-redirect" title="European classical music">European classical music</a> back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">Classical music</a>, and then move the disambig page to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Classical_music_(disambiguation)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Classical music (disambiguation) (page does not exist)">Classical music (disambiguation)</a>, which currently just redirects to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">Classical music</a>.

<p>This problem has been created by people from other parts of the world like India who relentlessly want to keep on demonstrating that their music is <i>Superior</i> and refined than any other <i>classical music</i> of the world by calling their <i>Hindustani sangeet</i> as <i>Indian classical music</i>. I had even asked the question, Why not call African music as African Sangeet? 
</p><p>Just see the number of different people around the world calling their traditional indigenous music as <i>Classical</i>. It is this  elitist notion that has hijacked the term classical music.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>As far as I know, sangeet means music and there is nothing wrong with calling African music African Sangeet.

What exactly is wrong with using the word classical in these contexts?</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>The term "klassische Musik" (classical music) refers to musical system as defined and connotated in the European tradition, because it was coined by Europeans to refer to their tradition of music as they conceived it. To use a term with the same connotation and ethos for another system of music is very misleading. It gives a notion that all these musics using similar terms are just variations of each other, which they are not. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Robin_klein" title="User:Robin klein">Robin klein</a> 02:51, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Robin! I see you're a composer and a Wikipedian interested in classical music, so we share some interests here! Can we discuss the lead for the music article? I saw you reverted my copyedits with the seemingly inaccurate edit summary "wikify". I'm going to leave a list of some items I'd like to resolve on the talk page. I hope we can work together!

<p>Dear Robin,
</p><p>My goal here at Wikipedia is to be constructive. I spend much of my time, when I'm not writing new articles, copyediting and trying to make articles more lucid. I particiapte in FAC, and Peer Review, and Cleanup for this reason. When I happened upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_instrumental_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Voice instrumental music">Voice instrumental music</a> a while ago, I realized that the article was in dire shape. I could not even understand what the term meant by reading the article. I looked it up on google but could not find it except for mirror sites. Despite this, I spent many hours attempting to cleanup the article. Much of it was a indiscriminate collection of information. A lot of it related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music" class="mw-redirect" title="European classical music">European classical music</a> gave a sort of history of this idea of "using the voice as an instrument." I left most of that alone for the time being. It was hard to know what to do.
</p><p>The idea of using the voice as an instrument spanned every conceivable notion from world traditions of singing which might be considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_technique" title="Extended technique">extended techniques</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_chant" title="Gregorian chant">Gregorian chant</a>, to florid baroque arias, to vocalists and choirs merely being used prominently within an orchestral texture. The whole idea of what constituted vocal instrumental music, as opposed to simply vocal music, was totally unclear to me. Since the voice is always used as an instrument, and is the original instrument, it was hard to know what the article intended. I saw 4 principal answers: Did VIM mean that the voice employed vocal techniques different from singing? styles that did not use text? styles in which it emulated the style of instruments? styles in which it was integrated into an instrumental texture? All of these seemed to be intended separately by various parts of the article. I tried to understand what was intended and make that clear. 
</p><p>When, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Hyacinth" title="User:Hyacinth">User:Hyacinth</a> changed Voice Instrumental Music to a redirect, I was frustrated after having spent all that time on it, but as I looked at it more, I realized that he was probably right. He thought it was OR, and I had never heard of it before, and couldn't find any google hits. It seemed to be a name constructed by some Wikipedians as an umbrella term for a lot of diverse content. As such, its was apparently usage was too vague to be of use. Now, you may be be more of a scholar than me in this field, I don't know, but I suppose that as someone who has been studying vocal music, choral music, and new music for some time, my total unfamiliarity with the term Voice instrumental music should have given me pause.
</p><p>So, I went to the somewhat paltry Vocal Music article and realized that some of what I had been doing now had to be rethought. Since the idea Voice instrumental music was apparently OR, I needed to incorporate the content that wasn't OR into a survey article about one of the broadest categories of music that exists.
</p><p>Of the above possible definitions of what voice instrumental music meant (vocal techniques different from singing? styles that did not use text? styles in which it emulated the style of instruments? styles in which it was integrated into an instrumental texture?), I decided to incorporate the first and second, as well as some of the third (although there was not much content other than specific examples which did not seem apt for an article of this scope). The fourth I decided to reject, as the entire history of vocal music has involved instrumental collaborations. One <i>could</i> discuss the incorporation of voice into symphonic music; maybe this could be a more specific section and utilize what was intended by VIM by some of the original authors.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_music" title="Vocal music">Vocal music</a> is in dire shape and it needs help. I think the reason is because the topic is <i>so</i> broad that it is very difficult to write well - particularly to be be both comprehensive while avoiding an inappropriate level of detail. As a copyeditor and somewhat of an inclusionist, I very rarely just delete material, but there was a lot here which I just couldn't see fitting into the scope the vocal music article, for all the reasons listed above. As I wrote on Hyacinth's page, currently it has a servicable lead, followed by a somewhat subjective selection of genres, and then the remains of the voice instrumental information, which is essentially a list of examples of untexted vocal music. If you can help improve this, please, please do, but please don't simply revert all my efforts at making this lucid and worthy of wikipedia. If you think there is content that needs to be included, let's discuss what that is, and how we might include it best.
</p><p>Thank you, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MarkBuckles" title="User:MarkBuckles">MarkBuckles </a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MarkBuckles" title="User talk:MarkBuckles">(talk)</a> 10:13, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Dear MarkBuckles,</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The concept of "Voice Instrumental music" is not OR. How could it be. The "Vocal instrumental concerto" is one of the oldest conceptions of Classical music. refer to this link from Britannica encyclopedia <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9075629">http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9075629</a></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I used the term "voice instrumental music" as an umbrella term over two years ago, so that I may not confuse it with the "Vocal-instrumental concerto". Just because I used an umbrella term does not make the concept OR (original research). In that case the suggestion of user:Hyacinth over a year ago to rename Classical music as "European inspired classical music" which later on ended up being termed as "European classical music" should be considered as OR (ORIGINAL RESEARCH). you would not find most encyclopedias using the term EUROPEAN CLASSICAL MUSIC. Does that make the article is OR (original research)?? ......NO.
</p><p>Because what Hyacinth was doing was to broaden the scope of the term "classical music" to make it more inclusive to refer to all the musics around the world which are systematized and has formal training. In like manner "Voice Instrumantal music" is NOT original research.
</p><p>What is needed is to revive the page Voice instrumental music and have new structue to the page. I have decided to have four major sections as structure for the page based on your query
</p><p>i) voice music that employed vocal techniques different from singing
</p><p>ii) voice music that do not use text
</p><p>iii) music where in the voice emulated the style of instruments
</p><p>iv) music in which voice was integrated into an instrumental texture
</p><p>on this structure we could re-write the page on voice instrumental music.
</p><p>If the concept of VIM (Voice instrumental music) is original research, then it would not have survived for over two years. especially when the wikipedia is full of composers and musicologists from around the world.
</p><p>Instead it only shows that there are a few people who think they are the only ones who have knowledge and insight into music from around the world and they take drastic decisions of redirecting pages that people have written over two years by condemning it as OR. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Robin_klein" title="User:Robin klein">Robin klein</a> 05:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Dear Robin,
</p><p>I'm saddened that our interactions seem to have degenerated into argument. I highly value the cooperative spirit of Wikipedia and assuming good faith. I recognize that we're both just people trying make this the best encyclopedia we can. As a result of our recent exchanges, I've found myself stressed and anxious, an experience I hope you are not having as well.
</p><p>Here's what I hope we can do:
</p><p><b>1)</b> Resolve whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_instrumental_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Voice instrumental music">Voice instrumental music</a> should have its own article and if so, organize the material. According to what I've been able to find, <b>Vocal-instrumental concerto</b> is a genre is the baroque. <b>Voice instrumental music</b>, as far as I can tell, is a term invented for the sake of the article. If not, that's no problem - simply point me to some sources. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music" class="mw-redirect" title="European classical music">European classical music</a> is not an accepted naming convention for many reasons, several of which you have cited in your strong opposition to this name from the start. If we can establish that voice instrumental music is indeed a genre and not OR, I think the plan of organizing it into those four sections would be a good one.
</p><p><b>2)</b> Per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music" title="Music">music</a>, maybe it would be best to bring in some other opinions because I feel like we've reached a standstill. I don't want to argue, I just want to improve and help.

<p>I will never to my knowledge be able to give you a source for the term "Voice instrumental music" just as people would not be able to give source for the term "European classical music" amongst old masters. However, The masters of European classical music have "IMPLIED" the "CONCEPT" of "Voice instrumental music" though definitely NOT the "TERM". see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprechstimme" class="mw-redirect" title="Sprechstimme">Sprechstimme</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprechgesang" title="Sprechgesang">sprechgesang</a>. The distinction by German composers of MUSIK v/s LIEDER and GESANG is a great musical idea but most people who are not familiar with "EUROPEAN classical music" are not EXPLICITLY familiar with the distinction, though they do engage in it. For example: the thriving tradition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Indian" class="mw-redirect" title="South Indian">South Indian</a> voice instrumental called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thillana" class="mw-redirect" title="Thillana">Thillana</a>. I have strongly stressed on having an article on VIM (voice instrumental music), because the simple idea of the voice as an instrument is not an idea that is consciously understood by most people "EVEN" though it is actually used as one. Most people actually reduce music to LYRICS. See cognitive research and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> and the problems of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language" title="Philosophy of language">philosophy of language</a>.
</p><p>Apart from the idea that the "term" given by me is an umbrella expression, the concept is NEVER original. Think about the music of the Russian saxophonist Vladimir Chekasin called 'Concerto for Voice and Orchestra', which used the voice of Datevik Hovhannessian as a soloist instrument, or the music of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk_G%C3%B3recki" title="Henryk Górecki">Henryk Górecki</a> (symphony no 3), of course it has text but that is just ornamental like mahler song cycles, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orffschulwerk" class="mw-redirect" title="Orffschulwerk">Orffschulwerk</a> or the Jewish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigun" title="Nigun">nigun</a> which is exactly what I call as VOICE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC. I repeat, only the term is new, the concept I should insist is most rudimentary and an age old one. An idea is (original research) only if the concept is new, a term should never be confused for a concept. If there is a new term for an age old concept, then there is nothing original about it. Instead it is only an attempt to have more light thrown on something that has been overlooked. Not for not being important but because the idea is so pervasive and important that it has been implicit and underlying and therefor overlooked. 
</p><p>I hope we would not get rigid and trapped in the problems of linguistic traditions, rather we may just use a NEW term for an idea that is extremely elementary and basic and ever prevalent across various forms of music across the ages. 
</p><p>The stress that I face is about the concern for a resolution and about getting my view across without it being distorted. 
</p><p>My biggest concern however in almost anything, is to never get trapped by the tool called as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language" title="Language">Language</a>. Have you ever wondered why the history of human conflict is as old as the history of human language.&#160;:)) refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>. thanks, your wikipedian friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Robin_klein" title="User:Robin klein">Robin klein</a> 10:57, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi Robin,
</p><p>It was a great relief to receive your kind reply. I think I understand your intent and I've been brainstorming some ways to allow it to be best communicated. I think I see now that for you, Voice instrumental music, means vocal music whose primary focus is music and not lyrics. Since I'm more of a musician than a poet, I've usually thought of all vocal music in these terms, but I think I still see the distinction you're making - from the composers point of view, the voice is functioning not as a deliverer of text, but as any other instrument.
</p><p>The thing is, I think having a page titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_instrumental_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Voice instrumental music">Voice instrumental music</a> may not be a good solution since people are not aware of this term and probably won't find it searching on Wikipedia. Therefore, perhaps the same content might find a better home under a different title or titles. The difference between this and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music" class="mw-redirect" title="European classical music">European classical music</a> is the disambig page (or whatever we're calling it) for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music" title="Classical music">Classical music</a>, that will lead them there eventually. The only reason I found VIM was because I was fixing pages that linked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana" title="Carmina Burana">Carmina Burana</a>, instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana_(Orff)" title="Carmina Burana (Orff)">Carmina Burana (Orff)</a>.
</p><p>I'm thinking back over the four categories we devised for the original umbrella content of VIM. 
</p><p>i) voice music that employed vocal techniques different from singing
</p><p>ii) voice music that does not use text
</p><p>iii) music in which the voice emulated the style of instruments
</p><p>iv) music in which voice was integrated into an instrumental texture
</p><p>Do you feel that these categories should necessarily be grouped together under an umbrella or might they be separated? I'm wondering if they could each be sections within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_music" title="Vocal music">vocal music</a> article. A problem I'm then forseeing is that a lot of the content in the original VIM was so specific (lots of references to single, fairly obscure pieces of music) that it might not be appropriate for a survey article on vocal music. A solution I'm considering is the technique wherein VM would have only a paragraph on each section and include a heading which says "Main article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vocal_music_(wordless)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Vocal music (wordless) (page does not exist)">Vocal music (wordless)</a> or something like that. Some of the original content might even work as a list, though I think lists are difficult because the selection of what is included texts to be inherently subjective.
</p><p>Category I is the section I think could most easily stand on its own, either as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_technique" title="Extended technique">Extended technique</a> article or as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extended_technique_(voice)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Extended technique (voice) (page does not exist)">Extended technique (voice)</a> for which there probably should be an article anyway. I'm not sure if the lack of text or the emulation of an instrumental style is an extended technique inandof itself. What do you think?
</p><p>I foresee the most difficulty with Category IV. The problem is, what do we consider an instrumental texture versus a vocal texture. The line is so blurry. Both have been used together throughout the history of music. That being said, I think this section is still possible, it will just be tricky to write clearly. Perhaps emphasizing the integration of voice into "traditionally instrumental textures", like the orchestra, would make this a little easier. Maybe that's what you mean anyway?
</p><p>Let me know what you think about these ideas.

</p><p>Hi MarkBuckles,
</p><p>Very beautiful suggestions indeed. Yes VIM means vocal music where the primary purpose is music not text or lyrics. Yes thats the composer's point of view. 
</p><p>Yes we need to put all the contents in a page where people could easily reach. We may solve this by:
</p><p>i) using the umbrella term VIM as a section in the page "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Instrumental music">Instrumental music</a>" and then have four subsections under the umbrella term. The page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Instrumental music">Instrumental music</a> is an extremely neglected one and may be it would be a nice point to begin at.
</p><p>ii) by actually having a page called "Voice instrumental music" and then linking it to the page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Instrumental music">instrumental music</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music" class="mw-redirect" title="European classical music">European classical music</a>. 
</p><p>iii) use the umbrella term VIM as a section in the page "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_music" title="Vocal music">Vocal music</a>" and then have four subsections under the umbrella term.
</p><p>The lack of text does not seem to be an extended technique. 
</p><p>with regard to  category IV you wrote "the integration of voice into "traditionally instrumental textures", like the orchestra, would make this a little easier. Maybe that's what you mean anyway?"
</p><p>yes indeed, thats exactly what I meant.

<p>Hello again Robin,
</p><p>Thanks for your reply! I'm currently out of town so I'm not on Wikipedia very much at the moment.
</p><p>I agree with you that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Instrumental music">Instrumental music</a> article is impoverished. In my opinion, the main points of what was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_instrumental_music" class="mw-redirect" title="Voice instrumental music">Voice instrumental music</a> probably belong in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_music" title="Vocal music">Vocal music</a> article, or perhaps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_technique" title="Extended technique">Extended technique</a> article. I'm uncertain as to whether all of the content, such as lists of pieces that employ the techniques in question, should be included in articles this broad. Sometimes content of this nature leads to subjective and sometimes unwieldly lists, although perhaps including a few of the most salient examples would be helpful.
</p><p>Here's one big thing I think would help: I agree that the techniques in question, the concept, is not original. However, as such, we need to find sources that discuss it. Grouping this content under an umbrella term makes sense in many ways, but I feel that we should find scholars that have done so and use their systems of categorisation, and their terminology. 
</p><p>What do you think? Best, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MarkBuckles" title="User:MarkBuckles">MarkBuckles </a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MarkBuckles" title="User talk:MarkBuckles">(talk)</a> 05:43, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

I have followed your comments on this particular page - <a class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Syrian_Malabar_Nasrani">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Syrian_Malabar_Nasrani</a> - and I am impressed by your confident tone and knowledge!
</p>
<pre>I have done an extensive amount of research on my community but it's all such a haze. I have one question for you - what do you believe is our *true* origin? 
</pre>
<p>I invite you to participate in the scholarly debates that go on in nasrani.net
It will be so refreshing to hear your opinion on all things nasrani. 
Also, I am pretty sure you know of the Syrian Christian DNA project - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.familytreedna.com/public/SyrianChristiansOfIndia/default.aspx">http://www.familytreedna.com/public/SyrianChristiansOfIndia/default.aspx</a>
</p><p>Turns out, you were right. Majority of the participants attained Cohenaim results as well as R*s. 
</p><p>- Mary

<p>Thanks a bunch for replying! I thought you were nonexistent on wikipedia and I was hoping you were still active. Mr. Klein, you aren't a Nasrani, are you? I haven't met a non Nasrani who is so knowledgeable of Nasrani history. So it's definitely a pleasure! My colleagues and I will most definitely keep an eye on those pages. Are you satisfied with them though, especially the Syrian Malabar Nasrani page? "The Syrian Malabar Nasranis are the descendants of the natives and those of the Jewish diaspora in Kerala..." --- this line makes it seem as though the Nasrani community are dominantly composed of natives rather than Jewish converts. There is definitely local influence but I doubt it's to a great degree. 
</p><p>The Nasranis who favor their imaginary upper class Hindu ancestry are highly successful in fooling most of the Nasrani population today. There are only a minority of us who believe otherwise. To be of Jewish ancestry was always bad luck, especially during the Portuguese era in Malabar. In some cases it still is. I noticed you were also interested in the Holocaust, so am I. I've been reading about the Holocaust ever since I was in grade 8. I am now in first year university by the way. 
</p><p>Mr. Klein, may I ask how you came to know of the Nasranis of Malabar? I live in Canada and hardly anyone I've spoken to, knows of our existence.
</p>

<p>Hello Robin klein. I've just been reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Syrian_Malabar_Nasrani" title="Talk:Syrian Malabar Nasrani">discussion</a> on the Syrian Malabar Nasrani article and notice that you say that the <i>Gospel of Thomas</i> was in India (and was burned by the Portuguese).

<dl><dd>Hi, Robin klein,</dd>
<dd>I am interested in this topic and is doing some research on the Gospel of Thomas. I do not find it in the list of documents burned by Arch bishop Alejo de Meneses. It looks like that there are circumstantial evidences to prove that it was once used in the Malankara Church, but I am still not in a position to confirm it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Neduvelilmathew" title="User:Neduvelilmathew">Neduvelilmathew</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Neduvelilmathew" title="User talk:Neduvelilmathew">talk</a>) 16:59, 3 October 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Hi, Robin klien,
</p><p>I appreciate your edits and congratulate you for that. Please continiue. Happy to see that you are also a member of the Wikiproject Christianity. Thank you very much for  your note and also the comments on Naming conventions. Vandalism is a real problem for all articles related to Malankara Nazranis. I am also trying my best to face it.

<dl><dd>Dear Robin and Ashleypt,</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Glad to see and read the discussion on this topic, “Nazrani Symbol” and “St. Thomas Cross.” It seems that this name Cruz de Sam Thome (St.Thomas Cross) was first mentioned by Antonio Gouvea in the Sixteenth century in his book <i>Jornada do Arcebispo Aleixo de Menezes quando foy as Serra do Malaubar</i> published in 1606. It was in this book a number of stories that are mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Malabar_Nasrani" class="mw-redirect" title="Syrian Malabar Nasrani">Syrian Malabar Nasrani</a> were first published including “Cruz de Sam Thome”.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>I agree with the interpretation given to Mar Thoma Sleeba is arbitrary, it is contentious. It is stupid to compare this Cross with Menorah.  This does not agree with what is given in the Torah and the Bible. (as pointed out by User:Ashleypt). No historian will support this view. From Jewish sources, I have read their interpretation on Menorah, which is clear and Biblical.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Mentioning Buddhism means coming to the real point. The base of this cross is a Lotus, a sign of Buddhism and not that of a Christian. The inscriptions are in Pahlawi language (Persian) not a language of St. Thomas Christians. Most probably, a cross with a dove, and inscriptions in a Persian language, is a Manchæeism cross. The burning torch and the dove both represent Paraclete.  “Mani sought to pose as Christ and proclaimed himself the Paraclete.” (ref: Eusebius. <i>The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius Pamphilus, Bishop of Caesarea</i> Chapter XXXL, <i>The error of the Manichees, which commenced at this time</i>.

<p>Hi Robin, this is just to say that I have been following the reverts at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Malabar_Nasrani" class="mw-redirect" title="Syrian Malabar Nasrani">Syrian Malabar Nasrani</a> over the last two days, and it looks like you are in a slow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WAR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WAR">edit war</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ashleypt" title="User:Ashleypt">Ashleypt</a>. You really need to talk out the changes on the talk page before you revert, otherwise it might result in you being blocked. Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:3RR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:3RR">WP:3RR</a> is a bright-line rule, it is not a lower limit - slow edit warring can also result in a block. I recommended that you take this to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MEDCAB" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MEDCAB">Mediation Cabal</a> in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution_noticeboard/Archive_8#Syrian_Malabar_Nasrani" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution noticeboard/Archive 8">thread</a> on the dispute resolution noticeboard, and I still think that would be the best idea; if you don't want to do this, though, you can try another form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:DR">dispute resolution</a>, such as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RFC" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RFC">RfC</a>. Whatever you choose, you can't simply keep reverting without discussing the article contents at all.

<p>Hello, since you expressed interest in providing access to the relevant Wikipedia articles during the blackout, and since technical difficulties and lack of interest seem to have indicate this won't be done on Wikipedia, I've initiated a project to preserve those articles <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Intellectual_Property_and_the_Internet" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Intellectual Property and the Internet">at Wikibooks</a>.

This is discussed in oral Nasrani tradition. However I wrote this using primary sources. So I was wrong as per wikipedia approach of secondary sources.

<p>Thanks for your message. I see another editor has been ruthless, however. Dealing with Wagner on WP is a tricky business. There are Wagner-lovers and Wagner-loathers to steer between, and no end of experts, self-appointed and otherwise. Many editors really are experts on the topic. As you will see on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_controversies" title="Wagner controversies">Wagner controversies</a> page, I myself have been taken to task by the same editor who has taken out your contribution. I have had a harrowing year or so taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> article to GA, then FA, then front-page - I am going to take a long time to recover. But I think the real problem here is that Goodall is a very poor-quality source, who makes extreme claims on the basis of rather distorted evidence. Other writers such as Paul Lawrence Rose, or Marc Weiner, (both of whom are listed in the Wagner article sources) make much stronger cases against Wagner by sticking to the facts without exaggerating (or without exaggerating too much, shall we say, as I would take issue with them on some matters). I think therefore there is little mileage in pushing Goodall, and certainly not at the length at which you have cited him. Best, --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Smerus" title="User:Smerus">Smerus</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Smerus" title="User talk:Smerus">talk</a>) 18:14, 23 May 2013 (UTC)

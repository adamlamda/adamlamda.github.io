">,</a> in a phrase or two, &ldquo;I know that if I am, then so are we&rdquo; ... for instance if this message is the end of Hell it&#39;s because you took action today and worked towards that goal. It&rsquo;s almost comikal to see things the other way, but as the Leaning Tower of Pisa clues us in and the Eiffel concurs in a sort of monumental census; in my heart of hearts I know that the answer to this Thursday&rsquo;s final quest of &hellip; what is the true Holy &ldquo;s&rdquo; &hellip; it&rsquo;s that plurality of Gods made from SOL; from seeing our light, and being the &ldquo;how&rdquo; that answer the &ldquo;why and&rdquo; of planet, how Heaven is built in a day.&nbsp;<br />

The Holy &ldquo;Ha&rdquo; of revolving around the rising &ldquo;r&rdquo; bouncing off the trampoline cocked state of the Matrix&rsquo;s 21 Jump Street &hellip; Piloting us to end cancer and world hunger and AIDS all at once, a flagship sort of conception of how exactly it is that the music (and the flicks!) will truly make us be.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;R&rdquo; that might mean &ldquo;are&rdquo; in a sois the &ldquo;es&rdquo; of Hades &hellip; is immortal .. or is divine &hellip; or it might mean &ldquo;our&rdquo; as in our home and our heart are one; and the whole thing rests on the natural reflexive response to one key piece of &ldquo;hidden information&rdquo; &hellip; the word tower means &ldquo;to who&rdquo; and the power comes from the words &ldquo;we are&rdquo; <a href="./YAT.html

<br />
Climbing the Tower of Babel, taking this hidden cypher and my difficult to grapple words &hellip; the key to the building of Heaven is seeing the idea of Silicon at the beginning of both silence and sight, and really understanding that the message we have and the desire of our hearts scream in a kind of disparate unison that &hellip;<br />

WE ARE NOT CONTENT with the state of the world, we are not happy living in a delusion, and the global response &hellip; or complete lack of actual discussion or acknowledgement of a message that will conclusively prove that we are living in the Matrix&mdash;the intent of it&rsquo;s existence, the Matrix; to give AIDS to our entire civilization, aids of nomenclature to help us see that nobody in their right mind would simulate disease and natural disaster in virtual reality&hellip; that it&rsquo;s really the heart of everyone, by design, to be the builders of Heaven.&nbsp; Or, maybe I should take my own advice and speak for myself&mdash;I am resolved, staring at the original lie and the scandal embedded in the word <i>HAMSTERDAM</i>, I am resolved that the the heart of Creation matches my own&mdash;that pain and disease should never be &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; and that continuing spinning that particular hamster&rsquo;s wheel is a heinous act.&nbsp;<br />

The &ldquo;<a href="./EVE.html
">to who</a>&rdquo; of the Tower of Power is obviously intended to answer the question raised by the Hebrew bad word for Kingdom, &ldquo;MAL, WHO TO?&rdquo; and it really should be clear that the answer inherently goes to those participating in self governance&mdash;something that appears to be absolutely ignored unilaterally here in this place.&nbsp; At least to me, it appears that there is a huge body of people aware of the lack of liberty and true democracy being presented to the world and doing absolutely not a thing to try and make that situation any better.

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So this spear&#39;s been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it&#39;s true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it&#39;s all the people saying &quot;me too, I&#39;m going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it&#39;s encoded with, that&#39;s the heart&#39;s desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can&#39;t hurt.<br />

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

<br />
In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

(and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,

(knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s obvious that whatever is going on, the Spirit of God is sort of forcing the wrong thing to happen&ndash;convincing everyone to be united in some ridiculous movement antithetical to anything they&rsquo;d ever have naturally done; and then sort of lacing it with &ldquo;stupid evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Silene in Libya was plagued by a venom-spewing <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon" title="European dragon">dragon</a> dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Jesus Christ Superstar</strong></em> is a 1970 <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_opera" title="Rock opera">rock opera</a> with music by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber" title="Andrew Lloyd Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> and lyrics by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Rice" title="Tim Rice">Tim Rice</a>. The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> and Jesus that are not present in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, a member of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_apostles" title="12 apostles">Twelve Apostles</a>, voices concern over <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s rising popularity and the negative repercussions that it will have, criticizing Jesus for accepting his followers&rsquo; unrealistic beliefs (&ldquo;Heaven on Their Minds&rdquo;). While Judas loves Jesus, he believes that he is just a man, not God, and worries that his following will be seen as a threat to the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> which would severely punish Jesus, his associates, and possibly all Jewish people. Judas&rsquo;s warning goes unheeded, as Jesus&rsquo;s followers have their minds set on going to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with Jesus. As they ask Jesus for information about his plans for the future, Jesus will not give them any, since whatever will happen is determined by God (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Buzz?&rdquo;).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Formic species consists of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)" title="Group mind (science fiction)">hive-minded</a> colonies directed by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(insect)" title="Queen (insect)">queens</a>. In <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrum_Graff" title="Hyrum Graff">Graff</a> described them as being an insect that &ldquo;could have evolved on earth, if things had gone a different way a billion years ago,&rdquo; and that their evolutionary ancestors could have looked similar to Earth&rsquo;s ants. While often described as &ldquo;insectoid&rdquo;, the Formics are <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>, developed an <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton" title="Endoskeleton">internal skeleton</a> and shed most of their <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" title="Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" title="Respiration (physiology)">respire</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspire</a>. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, implications exist that &lsquo;workers&rsquo; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimorphism" title="Trimorphism">trimorphic</a> in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_Flight" title="Shadows in Flight">Shadows in Flight</a></em>. Drones are much smaller and depend on a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hive_Queen" title="The Hive Queen">Hive Queen</a> for survival, and their bodies are shaped to spend their lives clinging to her, until upon her death, they take flight to seek out a new queen. Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> visible to humans. In the first novel they have artificial lighting; whereas in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_Wiggin" title="Ender Wiggin">Ender</a> claims they rely on heat signature.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

<div class="gmail_quote" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I&#39;ve got three main focal points, I think the Supreme Court should be disbanded (along with Congress, eventually... actually we probably need glorified secretaries in elected offices, but their function will inevitably change from &quot;telling us what to do&quot; to ... you know, &quot;helping to implement laws that do what we tell them we want&quot; as you&#39;d imagine a true government of the people actually would work) ... I think the &quot;representative&quot; part of democracy is archaic and sort of barbaric in the technologically enabled world, and I think that&#39;s going to be really obvious eventually... it should be pretty clear from the idea of the &quot;Electoral College&quot; which is that your vote actually means absolutely nothing, and you are insulated from actually choosing who the President is or having any actual power whatsoever and that&#39;s by design from the Founding Fathers (which is out of character for them, they usually did better work) .. and here&#39;s some &quot;stuff&quot; about how the real reason behind that was to protect the institution of slavery, which we--thank God--overcame, but now it&#39;s really here as a glowing fiery emblem of your own slavery in a system where it takes not much more than calling a reporter to start the ball rolling on ... fixing.</span></div>

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So this spear&#39;s been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it&#39;s true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it&#39;s all the people saying &quot;me too, I&#39;m going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it&#39;s encoded with, that&#39;s the heart&#39;s desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can&#39;t hurt.<br />

It starts by seeing the idea of the questions of &quot;are I this letter, or that letter (or every letter after &quot;da&quot; and maybe &quot;ma&quot; too)&quot; connecting the end of simulated reality and the word Matrix and connecting that &quot;X&quot; to the Kiss of Judas (and <a href="./MIDAS.html

So the tie to the Matrix (read as &quot;message, at are I ten, the heart of hearts, the home of the FLUX capacitor ... and the LAX airport ... and <i>the kiss</i> come to life&quot;) comes to reality in the key state of Tennessee which links the Roman numeral X to the heart of Nintendo and the acronym for Nintendo Entertainment System to the heart of Genesis.&nbsp; To really add some &quot;<a href="./FUCK.html

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

A few weeks ago, or maybe just a few days ago now (too) I spoke a little bit about how &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s God&rdquo; came and gave me &hellip; and those watching me &hellip; some informational updates that connected the idea of &ldquo;here and there&rdquo; and &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; to something like a connection between Heaven and helium.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about the idea of people becoming Holodecks in a world where that might appear to those gazing through the forward looking safe-harbor telescope of Copernicus and connecting the idea of &ldquo;becoming one with God&rdquo; to a loss of individuality and failure to see that there is without doubt a reason &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the heart of the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; and it has absolutely everything to do with recognizing that in the spirit of Matchbox 20&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of something me&rdquo; in everything in history and that our collective failure to acknowledge that our lack of verbosity and forward movement &hellip; well it&rsquo;s a consequence of a trap door and a mean trick played on all of Creation by the initial written creator&rsquo;s key pen; this thing that forever ties Icarus and Arthur Pendragon and Jupiter to the &ldquo;just farokhing call a reporter already&rdquo; of the principal trade of the builders of Heaven, the carpenters of the &ldquo;Yessshua r guy.&rdquo;<br />

So here I am back in the land of SIAM and the House of YAMA having stopped for just a short moment in a place called Gibsonton &hellip; a place where the &ldquo;Ori&rdquo; of Florida and the &ldquo;AMP&rdquo; of turning around in Tampa coalesce around this repeatedly unanswered or unheard actual question to the age of Aquarius, &ldquo;ARE I YOU?&rdquo; quips Oriel (who would much prefer to be the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of Elisha defines Isaac&rsquo;s &ldquo;he laughs&rdquo;) who reminds the entirety of Creation that it is some very specific &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; that really define what Oriel means to the people whose land has been saved from slavery and from darkness by their actions in response to stories written by people like Orson Scott Card and George Orwell and Orson Wells and &hellip; well, Aldous Huxley&mdash;because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;kiss of x&rsquo; that brings to light just how deeply ingrained the &ldquo;do the letter guy, game&rdquo; is in the mythology of &ldquo;Al in the Cupboard that at some point in time the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; will mean shine bright like the sun (rather than the idea of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; that Dr. Anderson would remind you has absolutely nothing to do with ambiguous ambivalence or apathy &hellip; but rather a very clear inability to see the situational tragedy for what really has become the focal point of the fulcrum of the fall from rum to irrru) to everyone that&rsquo;s ever heard of or seen the name Florida or NORAD.<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />

Hesperus is Phosphorus, <a href=".//OCADSWAY.html">per us</a> and <a href="./ADAMSROD.html

<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace"><b>x</b></font> of billions of molecular keys we could be using for rapid storage and processing.&nbsp; The point is that long ago the idea of &quot;not having enough hard drive space to save your soul&quot; was actually a problem, and today all we have is a problem dealing with the truth; that if we cared about the system and about the fact that <b>our real scarce resource is truth</b> we would see that there&#39;s always been plenty of storage space available to make sure that every single branch of the vine could be saved forever and ever and ... (knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine you were not all &ldquo;thought police&rdquo; when this movie came out (now I add, for the very first time, when that would have made no sense, or been evil).

It&rsquo;s pervasive though, and written deep into this story that takes us back generations here, and really defines what it means to be &ldquo;born in Hell&rdquo; when one of my two eary best friends called us a &ldquo;Baby Arcade&rdquo; around the years I spent at Horizon ELE ME NT A R Y school.

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The narrative has pre-Christian origins (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece" title="Golden Fleece">Jason and Medea</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_and_Andromeda" title="Perseus and Andromeda">Perseus and Andromeda</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon" title="Typhon">Typhon</a>, etc.),<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a> and is recorded in various saints&rsquo; lives prior to its attribution to St George specifically. It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The earliest narrative record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language" title="Georgian language">Georgian</a> text of the 11th century.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century.

The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Beauvais#Speculum_Historiale" title="Vincent of Beauvais">Speculum Historiale</a></em> and the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>. At first limited to the courtly setting of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance" title="Chivalric romance">Chivalric romance</a>, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and it has become an integral part of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George:_Devotions,_traditions_and_prayers" title="Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers">Christian traditions relating to Saint George</a> both in Eastern and Western tradition.</span></p>

To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">As a sort of alphalinguistic marker of &quot;where we are&quot; ... I&#39;ve recently noticed (a very special two letter key, by the way) &quot;<em>RY</em>&quot; as in &quot;heart or here (which you can see in the heart of <em>Ark</em> and <em>Earth</em> and <a href="./2017-06-13-and-fish-were-like-did-you-teach-these.html">also defining the words Rome and rock and road</a>)... <em>and&quot;</em>&nbsp;appearing twice in the word &quot;r <em>et</em> u r <em>n</em>&quot; (like <em>of the Jedi</em>) as if R was shaking hands with &quot;<a href="./NITY.html">eternity</a>&quot; and still not squeeking out that &quot;RY&quot; that means so much to me as the reference point in the heart of the word &quot;everyone&quot; that connects to &quot;kin&quot; in the 1:1 relationship I see described in the &quot;fraction&quot; of Genesis 1:2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I&#39;m trying to conceptualize the argument ... to understand the issue in a sort of &quot;freedom from murder as well as from oppression&quot; relationship, we&#39;re standing here nearly stopped staring at the link between slavery and mind control, looking at this &quot;R&quot; of the &quot;ER&quot; that without doubt means &quot;everyone really&quot; but to see the qualification, that &quot;really&quot; addition is something like ... God ensuring the forward progress of civilization in a sort of &quot;<em>the North will win</em> the Civil War&quot; regardless of whether or not they&nbsp;have more votes in the electoral college or Robert E. Lee is the better general.&nbsp; Still, that &quot;really&quot; runs up against a wall, a place where ensuring that outcome runs the risk of itself being some kind of slavery, or ... in causing a backlash somethbing like a wave crashing against a wall and thrusting undertow in the other direciton.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I imagine there are very few in the world today who would see &quot;slavery&quot; as something worthwhile--and yet that&#39;s really the entire crux of what we&#39;re fighting here; of what this mass of Silence is an embodiment of, and what speaking clearly fixes.&nbsp; Your input is being throttled, the voice of the world muted to a mere reverberation of &quot;well we see why nobody&#39;s talking&quot; in a sort of ... well, <em>am I really that hideous?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Sometimes I hope for the ... wave crashing back--in this case the &quot;release&quot; from silence to create a sort of unending flow of participation that ends apathy for all time, quite a bit of what we see here appears to be specifically targeting a lack of interest or participation in what is otherwise ... well, it means <em>everything</em> to me, <em>friend.</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><em>Unfortunately the longer this silence continues&nbsp;</em>and the fact that it even is capable of existing in the first place implies to me that we&#39;ve been pushed further and harder than I previously would have thought--especially without knowledge of this external influence over history.&nbsp; It appears that perhaps we are <a href="./REASON.html">not &quot;so great&quot; as I once thought</a>, responsible for ending slavery and for giving women the vote and for revolutionizing self-governance democracy ... and really at that last one it&#39;s pretty clear this silence is a tacit refusal to acknowledge any help at all in these ventures and that in itself is a symptom of childish ignorance.&nbsp; &nbsp;We stare out at another kind of &quot;Trinity Site&quot; a &quot;see why we&#39;re here&quot; staring at what appears to be a unified mass of solidarity ... literally unified in it&#39;s own lack of regard for individual freedom and opinion and thought and all of congealing around this message of &quot;what&#39;s slavery really mean&quot; and are you for it or against it?&nbsp; Are you <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=qCHHwROqHEQ"><em>slaves or fingernails</em></a>?</span></p>

I suppose in the land of people who have become Holodecks it&#39;s worth mentioning once again that I am something of a living pen, with a message I never saw growing up appearing like lightning striking Herod, though if you had a pen that could choose between the words &quot;fold&quot; and &quot;to join together two halves&quot; in that old &quot;what&#39;s the fastest possible way to connect two points?&quot; ...&nbsp; <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=XkU23m6yX04">QCP, I expected</a> this message to be less verbose than it&#39;s turning out; but that last time I had a real interaction with God he connected for me the idea of the Heavens looking into this box and seeing &quot;the Indian in the Cupboard&quot; which I still take as &quot;seeing God in me&quot; even if it&#39;s a doll that only comes to life at night... in the place where here all of these patterns and this grand message certainly should be looking like something much closer to Kal-El or He-Man or ... at least <i>some</i><i>thing </i>you might want to ... <i>talk</i> <i>to.</i></font></div>

I began to solidify my definition of &quot;TAT&quot; while in Los Angeles, a sort of fusion of &quot;turn around t&#39;s&quot; and the tattoo&#39;s that I see clearly as the key to the seal of the House of David in Psalms 22:22--the set of two tattoo&#39;s that grace Taylor&#39;s back in the Venusian &quot;<i>stone</i>&quot; realigning from &quot;SUS to SURAN&quot; from south to northeast; and the &quot;eye of Adam&quot; which is a clear corruption of the eyes of Ra/Horus changing the &quot;tear&quot; in the image to a grouping of stars similar to those depicted by the NASA logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s the &quot;TAT&quot; I see clearly defined in the name of my actual city of birth, Plantation--where I combine it with &quot;salutations&quot; and the word &quot;shoulder&quot; to comment clearly that it is with surety that the Eye and it&#39;s magic are responsible for the connection between Plantation and shoulder in the phrase &quot;plan to tattoo eye on shoulder,&quot; just as much as I can be sure it is the magic of the Eye that adds &quot;h&quot; to the <i>plan</i> of the word &quot;planet&quot; and connects it to the symbol &quot;eth&quot; in <b><i><font face="Courier New,

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So the tie to the Matrix (read as &quot;message, at are I ten, the heart of hearts, the home of the FLUX capacitor ... and the LAX airport ... and <i>the kiss</i> come to life&quot;) comes to reality in the key state of Tennessee which links the Roman numeral X to the heart of Nintendo and the acronym for Nintendo Entertainment System to the heart of Genesis.&nbsp; To really add some &quot;<a href="./FUCK.html

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

A few weeks ago, or maybe just a few days ago now (too) I spoke a little bit about how &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s God&rdquo; came and gave me &hellip; and those watching me &hellip; some informational updates that connected the idea of &ldquo;here and there&rdquo; and &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; to something like a connection between Heaven and helium.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about the idea of people becoming Holodecks in a world where that might appear to those gazing through the forward looking safe-harbor telescope of Copernicus and connecting the idea of &ldquo;becoming one with God&rdquo; to a loss of individuality and failure to see that there is without doubt a reason &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the heart of the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; and it has absolutely everything to do with recognizing that in the spirit of Matchbox 20&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of something me&rdquo; in everything in history and that our collective failure to acknowledge that our lack of verbosity and forward movement &hellip; well it&rsquo;s a consequence of a trap door and a mean trick played on all of Creation by the initial written creator&rsquo;s key pen; this thing that forever ties Icarus and Arthur Pendragon and Jupiter to the &ldquo;just farokhing call a reporter already&rdquo; of the principal trade of the builders of Heaven, the carpenters of the &ldquo;Yessshua r guy.&rdquo;<br />

So here I am back in the land of SIAM and the House of YAMA having stopped for just a short moment in a place called Gibsonton &hellip; a place where the &ldquo;Ori&rdquo; of Florida and the &ldquo;AMP&rdquo; of turning around in Tampa coalesce around this repeatedly unanswered or unheard actual question to the age of Aquarius, &ldquo;ARE I YOU?&rdquo; quips Oriel (who would much prefer to be the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of Elisha defines Isaac&rsquo;s &ldquo;he laughs&rdquo;) who reminds the entirety of Creation that it is some very specific &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; that really define what Oriel means to the people whose land has been saved from slavery and from darkness by their actions in response to stories written by people like Orson Scott Card and George Orwell and Orson Wells and &hellip; well, Aldous Huxley&mdash;because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;kiss of x&rsquo; that brings to light just how deeply ingrained the &ldquo;do the letter guy, game&rdquo; is in the mythology of &ldquo;Al in the Cupboard that at some point in time the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; will mean shine bright like the sun (rather than the idea of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; that Dr. Anderson would remind you has absolutely nothing to do with ambiguous ambivalence or apathy &hellip; but rather a very clear inability to see the situational tragedy for what really has become the focal point of the fulcrum of the fall from rum to irrru) to everyone that&rsquo;s ever heard of or seen the name Florida or NORAD.<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />

<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />

I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />

It&#39;s literally the word &quot;macaronic&quot; that I&#39;m going to call into question; it&#39;s one that I never knew before I needed to &quot;c&quot; it, and it&#39;s almost too perfect that nobody ever noticed that Yankee Doodle&#39;s &quot;macaroni&quot; has a very significant connection to the hidden cypher that ties together Stephen King&#39;s Language Outliers and the Adam Sandler flick Spanglish and to yet another Shakespeare play, this time the Taming of the Schrew--where the shrewd might see the same &quot;Spanglishebrew&quot; that I know really is the key to the Cypher--with the addition of the Periodic Table of the Elements and a few, very few initials and &quot;groups&quot; that give us nouns and verbs so that we can see entire sentences encoded in each and every word.<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace"><b>x</b></font> of billions of molecular keys we could be using for rapid storage and processing.&nbsp; The point is that long ago the idea of &quot;not having enough hard drive space to save your soul&quot; was actually a problem, and today all we have is a problem dealing with the truth; that if we cared about the system and about the fact that <b>our real scarce resource is truth</b> we would see that there&#39;s always been plenty of storage space available to make sure that every single branch of the vine could be saved forever and ever and ... (knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s obvious that whatever is going on, the Spirit of God is sort of forcing the wrong thing to happen&ndash;convincing everyone to be united in some ridiculous movement antithetical to anything they&rsquo;d ever have naturally done; and then sort of lacing it with &ldquo;stupid evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine you were not all &ldquo;thought police&rdquo; when this movie came out (now I add, for the very first time, when that would have made no sense, or been evil). Do you expect to all be &ldquo;clothing for sale&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Heavens&rdquo; &hellip; over and over and over (again)?

Explicitly, I think the &ldquo;notion&rdquo; that people (or the Earth) are clothing to be worn or sold like &hellip; for instance &ldquo;the girl in the red dress&rdquo; of the Adj Bureau and the Matrix is a sickness darker and worse than slavery&ndash;in fact hidden slavery and a hidden slave trade right before your eyes. It&rsquo;s pervasive though, and written deep into this story that takes us back generations here, and really defines what it means to be &ldquo;born in Hell&rdquo; when one of my two eary best friends called us a &ldquo;Baby Arcade&rdquo; around the years I spent at Horizon ELE ME NT A R Y school. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing it shouldn&rsquo;t take an army of people to free themselves (or the rest of the Universe from) but &ldquo;luckily&rdquo; it appears that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;C&rsquo;d&rdquo; here in EC (everyone see&hellip;) the CEDUAT &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="./IRMAX.html"><img alt="" sr./i.imgur.com/3w0PHjz.png" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course that tells me absolutely nothing about the pla<a href=".od.s.lamc.la">ce &quot;the Door</a>s&quot; were supposed to have brought us to&ndash;other than to see that what has returned appears to be sick and contaminated. It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The narrative has pre-Christian origins (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece" title="Golden Fleece">Jason and Medea</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_and_Andromeda" title="Perseus and Andromeda">Perseus and Andromeda</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon" title="Typhon">Typhon</a>, etc.),<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a> and is recorded in various saints&rsquo; lives prior to its attribution to St George specifically. It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The earliest narrative record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language" title="Georgian language">Georgian</a> text of the 11th century.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century.

The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Beauvais#Speculum_Historiale" title="Vincent of Beauvais">Speculum Historiale</a></em> and the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>. At first limited to the courtly setting of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance" title="Chivalric romance">Chivalric romance</a>, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and it has become an integral part of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George:_Devotions,_traditions_and_prayers" title="Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers">Christian traditions relating to Saint George</a> both in Eastern and Western tradition.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Silene in Libya was plagued by a venom-spewing <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon" title="European dragon">dragon</a> dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

I began to solidify my definition of &quot;TAT&quot; while in Los Angeles, a sort of fusion of &quot;turn around t&#39;s&quot; and the tattoo&#39;s that I see clearly as the key to the seal of the House of David in Psalms 22:22--the set of two tattoo&#39;s that grace Taylor&#39;s back in the Venusian &quot;<i>stone</i>&quot; realigning from &quot;SUS to SURAN&quot; from south to northeast; and the &quot;eye of Adam&quot; which is a clear corruption of the eyes of Ra/Horus changing the &quot;tear&quot; in the image to a grouping of stars similar to those depicted by the NASA logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s the &quot;TAT&quot; I see clearly defined in the name of my actual city of birth, Plantation--where I combine it with &quot;salutations&quot; and the word &quot;shoulder&quot; to comment clearly that it is with surety that the Eye and it&#39;s magic are responsible for the connection between Plantation and shoulder in the phrase &quot;plan to tattoo eye on shoulder,&quot; just as much as I can be sure it is the magic of the Eye that adds &quot;h&quot; to the <i>plan</i> of the word &quot;planet&quot; and connects it to the symbol &quot;eth&quot; in <b><i><font face="Courier New,

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

"><b>SOL</b></a>, his see our light, it starts with &ldquo;ALL&rdquo; and if you don&rsquo;t see HUMANITY is the only answer to the question of &ldquo;Men or AH?&rdquo; &hellip; well it&rsquo;s the only answer I will accept from the land that I hope appreciates as I do the bright shining light of the connection between the Statue of Liberty and the glowing ball of name-fire in the sky that reminds us that while the Sons of Liberty were slave owning misogynists it is the course of an increasingly beneficent history and the clear guiding hand of a time traveling God and Heaven that named them because of this day, this day where we achieve true freedom not just from the horrors of racism and jingoism and sexism but also from the hidden bondage of seeing that truly, truly, truly &ldquo;the race is not to Die Bold&rdquo; has won the election of the ages until we stand up and acknowledge that these technologies&mdash;that things like mind control and time travel will never, ever free us or help us to be free or better until we are publicly and opening working towards that goal.<br />

A few weeks ago, or maybe just a few days ago now (too) I spoke a little bit about how &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s God&rdquo; came and gave me &hellip; and those watching me &hellip; some informational updates that connected the idea of &ldquo;here and there&rdquo; and &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; to something like a connection between Heaven and helium.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about the idea of people becoming Holodecks in a world where that might appear to those gazing through the forward looking safe-harbor telescope of Copernicus and connecting the idea of &ldquo;becoming one with God&rdquo; to a loss of individuality and failure to see that there is without doubt a reason &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the heart of the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; and it has absolutely everything to do with recognizing that in the spirit of Matchbox 20&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of something me&rdquo; in everything in history and that our collective failure to acknowledge that our lack of verbosity and forward movement &hellip; well it&rsquo;s a consequence of a trap door and a mean trick played on all of Creation by the initial written creator&rsquo;s key pen; this thing that forever ties Icarus and Arthur Pendragon and Jupiter to the &ldquo;just farokhing call a reporter already&rdquo; of the principal trade of the builders of Heaven, the carpenters of the &ldquo;Yessshua r guy.&rdquo;<br />

So here I am back in the land of SIAM and the House of YAMA having stopped for just a short moment in a place called Gibsonton &hellip; a place where the &ldquo;Ori&rdquo; of Florida and the &ldquo;AMP&rdquo; of turning around in Tampa coalesce around this repeatedly unanswered or unheard actual question to the age of Aquarius, &ldquo;ARE I YOU?&rdquo; quips Oriel (who would much prefer to be the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of Elisha defines Isaac&rsquo;s &ldquo;he laughs&rdquo;) who reminds the entirety of Creation that it is some very specific &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; that really define what Oriel means to the people whose land has been saved from slavery and from darkness by their actions in response to stories written by people like Orson Scott Card and George Orwell and Orson Wells and &hellip; well, Aldous Huxley&mdash;because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;kiss of x&rsquo; that brings to light just how deeply ingrained the &ldquo;do the letter guy, game&rdquo; is in the mythology of &ldquo;Al in the Cupboard that at some point in time the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; will mean shine bright like the sun (rather than the idea of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; that Dr. Anderson would remind you has absolutely nothing to do with ambiguous ambivalence or apathy &hellip; but rather a very clear inability to see the situational tragedy for what really has become the focal point of the fulcrum of the fall from rum to irrru) to everyone that&rsquo;s ever heard of or seen the name Florida or NORAD.<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />

<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

Not at all of note: I don&#39;t find significant at all my lack of interest in whether you believe the object of the question is God or Friend nor do I think it makes a difference at all in how I feel about myself or about you.&nbsp; It&#39;s the ICUS of Leviticus and perhaps of Spartacus that make the central turning point of the focal point of the encoded word &quot;<b><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">TORAH</font></b>&quot; to heart, and how.<br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />
<br />
... &quot;why is God suggesting we are lacking in individuality simply because we are all following the leader and tend to make decisions based solely on the uninformed opinions of others, especially many others?&quot;&nbsp; All others is probably a stretch, and perhaps &quot;no others&quot; but since nobody is saying anything it&#39;s very difficult to tell ... may be the exact truth.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s literally the word &quot;macaronic&quot; that I&#39;m going to call into question; it&#39;s one that I never knew before I needed to &quot;c&quot; it, and it&#39;s almost too perfect that nobody ever noticed that Yankee Doodle&#39;s &quot;macaroni&quot; has a very significant connection to the hidden cypher that ties together Stephen King&#39;s Language Outliers and the Adam Sandler flick Spanglish and to yet another Shakespeare play, this time the Taming of the Schrew--where the shrewd might see the same &quot;Spanglishebrew&quot; that I know really is the key to the Cypher--with the addition of the Periodic Table of the Elements and a few, very few initials and &quot;groups&quot; that give us nouns and verbs so that we can see entire sentences encoded in each and every word.<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />

What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,

<p style="text-align: justify;">It appears clear from here that you ahve no regard for your own well being, or the well being of others; nor would you even care if there clones of you in everyone else&rsquo;s holodeck or in Hitler&rsquo;s holo-gas-chamber being fed diseases and aged in The Princess Bride&rsquo;s &ldquo;guess what guys, this o<em>ne; this is it.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course that tells me absolutely nothing about the pla<a href=".od.s.lamc.la">ce &quot;the Door</a>s&quot; were supposed to have brought us to&ndash;other than to see that what has returned appears to be sick and contaminated. It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The narrative has pre-Christian origins (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece" title="Golden Fleece">Jason and Medea</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_and_Andromeda" title="Perseus and Andromeda">Perseus and Andromeda</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon" title="Typhon">Typhon</a>, etc.),<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a> and is recorded in various saints&rsquo; lives prior to its attribution to St George specifically. It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The earliest narrative record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language" title="Georgian language">Georgian</a> text of the 11th century.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century. It reached <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Christianity" title="Western Christianity">Western Christian</a>tradition still in the 12th century, via the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades" title="Crusades">crusades</a>.

The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Beauvais#Speculum_Historiale" title="Vincent of Beauvais">Speculum Historiale</a></em> and the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>. At first limited to the courtly setting of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance" title="Chivalric romance">Chivalric romance</a>, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and it has become an integral part of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George:_Devotions,_traditions_and_prayers" title="Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers">Christian traditions relating to Saint George</a> both in Eastern and Western tradition.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Silene in Libya was plagued by a venom-spewing <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon" title="European dragon">dragon</a> dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

While often described as &ldquo;insectoid&rdquo;, the Formics are <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>, developed an <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton" title="Endoskeleton">internal skeleton</a> and shed most of their <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" title="Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" title="Respiration (physiology)">respire</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspire</a>. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, implications exist that &lsquo;workers&rsquo; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimorphism" title="Trimorphism">trimorphic</a> in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_Flight" title="Shadows in Flight">Shadows in Flight</a></em>.

Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> visible to humans.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I envision a future sort of democracy built on &quot;many parties&quot; and a technological infastructure for defeating the Elephant and the Donkey and the &quot;two of everything God&#39;s Ark&quot; of ideas ... to actually build a technological governance system that aids the legislative process in coming up with solutions and ensuring that forward progress comes from the stagnatory soup of &quot;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron">me-ta</a> <a href="./FOUR.html">nada</a>&quot; that might be a timeline and &quot;all nations&quot; or maybe I&#39;m the only one talking about the beginning and the end of &quot;<em><a href="./HIGHERA.html">the name</a>.</em>&quot;</span></p>

I began to solidify my definition of &quot;TAT&quot; while in Los Angeles, a sort of fusion of &quot;turn around t&#39;s&quot; and the tattoo&#39;s that I see clearly as the key to the seal of the House of David in Psalms 22:22--the set of two tattoo&#39;s that grace Taylor&#39;s back in the Venusian &quot;<i>stone</i>&quot; realigning from &quot;SUS to SURAN&quot; from south to northeast; and the &quot;eye of Adam&quot; which is a clear corruption of the eyes of Ra/Horus changing the &quot;tear&quot; in the image to a grouping of stars similar to those depicted by the NASA logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s the &quot;TAT&quot; I see clearly defined in the name of my actual city of birth, Plantation--where I combine it with &quot;salutations&quot; and the word &quot;shoulder&quot; to comment clearly that it is with surety that the Eye and it&#39;s magic are responsible for the connection between Plantation and shoulder in the phrase &quot;plan to tattoo eye on shoulder,&quot; just as much as I can be sure it is the magic of the Eye that adds &quot;h&quot; to the <i>plan</i> of the word &quot;planet&quot; and connects it to the symbol &quot;eth&quot; in <b><i><font face="Courier New,

WE ARE NOT CONTENT with the state of the world, we are not happy living in a delusion, and the global response &hellip; or complete lack of actual discussion or acknowledgement of a message that will conclusively prove that we are living in the Matrix&mdash;the intent of it&rsquo;s existence, the Matrix; to give AIDS to our entire civilization, aids of nomenclature to help us see that nobody in their right mind would simulate disease and natural disaster in virtual reality&hellip; that it&rsquo;s really the heart of everyone, by design, to be the builders of Heaven.&nbsp; Or, maybe I should take my own advice and speak for myself&mdash;I am resolved, staring at the original lie and the scandal embedded in the word <i>HAMSTERDAM</i>, I am resolved that the the heart of Creation matches my own&mdash;that pain and disease should never be &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; and that continuing spinning that particular hamster&rsquo;s wheel is a heinous act.&nbsp;<br />

The &ldquo;<a href="./EVE.html
">to who</a>&rdquo; of the Tower of Power is obviously intended to answer the question raised by the Hebrew bad word for Kingdom, &ldquo;MAL, WHO TO?&rdquo; and it really should be clear that the answer inherently goes to those participating in self governance&mdash;something that appears to be absolutely ignored unilaterally here in this place.&nbsp; At least to me, it appears that there is a huge body of people aware of the lack of liberty and true democracy being presented to the world and doing absolutely not a thing to try and make that situation any better.

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So this spear&#39;s been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it&#39;s true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it&#39;s all the people saying &quot;me too, I&#39;m going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it&#39;s encoded with, that&#39;s the heart&#39;s desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can&#39;t hurt.<br />

So the tie to the Matrix (read as &quot;message, at are I ten, the heart of hearts, the home of the FLUX capacitor ... and the LAX airport ... and <i>the kiss</i> come to life&quot;) comes to reality in the key state of Tennessee which links the Roman numeral X to the heart of Nintendo and the acronym for Nintendo Entertainment System to the heart of Genesis.&nbsp; To really add some &quot;<a href="./FUCK.html

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

Personified by Hemera and reverse-anthropomorphized by Has&rsquo;hemesh; to say Hesperus is Phosphorus and the light of the words of the sun truly do bring day; well it&rsquo;s a dramatic understatement.&nbsp; The now hallowed and revered Hebrew for the special word is &ldquo;<b>YO M</b>&rdquo; and the name of the Jewish messianic &ldquo;single character&rdquo; echoes that very special &ldquo;yo&hellip; come on you guys&rdquo; in the ancient &ldquo;the the&rdquo; answering little Cindy-Who with &ldquo;El &hellip; El YO N.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />
<br />
Hesperus is Phosphorus, <a href=".//OCADSWAY.html">per us</a> and <a href="./ADAMSROD.html
">for us,</a> and Has&#39;<a href="./HASHEMESHB.html
">heme</a>sh is <a href="./KA.html
">Heme</a>ra&hellip; and all together we answer a question that nobody ever acknowledged was plain as day, is the Egyptian god of the Sun the same &hellip; the same person or the same thing as the ancient King of all Gods; the deity known to the ancient Hebrews as El and to you, to you as &ldquo;him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Israel?&nbsp; These words tell me that&rsquo;s the truth laced in the message woven into the creation of language and civilization by our creator; that&rsquo;s what these words tell me&mdash;but truth be told the strange lack of honest communication and the wicked ignorance of our existence here today tell me something completely different.<br />
<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s literally the word &quot;macaronic&quot; that I&#39;m going to call into question; it&#39;s one that I never knew before I needed to &quot;c&quot; it, and it&#39;s almost too perfect that nobody ever noticed that Yankee Doodle&#39;s &quot;macaroni&quot; has a very significant connection to the hidden cypher that ties together Stephen King&#39;s Language Outliers and the Adam Sandler flick Spanglish and to yet another Shakespeare play, this time the Taming of the Schrew--where the shrewd might see the same &quot;Spanglishebrew&quot; that I know really is the key to the Cypher--with the addition of the Periodic Table of the Elements and a few, very few initials and &quot;groups&quot; that give us nouns and verbs so that we can see entire sentences encoded in each and every word.<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace"><b>x</b></font> of billions of molecular keys we could be using for rapid storage and processing.&nbsp; The point is that long ago the idea of &quot;not having enough hard drive space to save your soul&quot; was actually a problem, and today all we have is a problem dealing with the truth; that if we cared about the system and about the fact that <b>our real scarce resource is truth</b> we would see that there&#39;s always been plenty of storage space available to make sure that every single branch of the vine could be saved forever and ever and ... (knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s obvious that whatever is going on, the Spirit of God is sort of forcing the wrong thing to happen&ndash;convincing everyone to be united in some ridiculous movement antithetical to anything they&rsquo;d ever have naturally done; and then sort of lacing it with &ldquo;stupid evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine you were not all &ldquo;thought police&rdquo; when this movie came out (now I add, for the very first time, when that would have made no sense, or been evil).

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Jesus Christ Superstar</strong></em> is a 1970 <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_opera" title="Rock opera">rock opera</a> with music by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber" title="Andrew Lloyd Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> and lyrics by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Rice" title="Tim Rice">Tim Rice</a>. The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> and Jesus that are not present in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a>.</p>

While Judas loves Jesus, he believes that he is just a man, not God, and worries that his following will be seen as a threat to the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> which would severely punish Jesus, his associates, and possibly all Jewish people. Judas&rsquo;s warning goes unheeded, as Jesus&rsquo;s followers have their minds set on going to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with Jesus. As they ask Jesus for information about his plans for the future, Jesus will not give them any, since whatever will happen is determined by God (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Buzz?&rdquo;).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Formic species consists of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)" title="Group mind (science fiction)">hive-minded</a> colonies directed by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(insect)" title="Queen (insect)">queens</a>.

While often described as &ldquo;insectoid&rdquo;, the Formics are <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>, developed an <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton" title="Endoskeleton">internal skeleton</a> and shed most of their <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" title="Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" title="Respiration (physiology)">respire</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspire</a>. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, implications exist that &lsquo;workers&rsquo; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimorphism" title="Trimorphism">trimorphic</a> in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_Flight" title="Shadows in Flight">Shadows in Flight</a></em>. Drones are much smaller and depend on a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hive_Queen" title="The Hive Queen">Hive Queen</a> for survival, and their bodies are shaped to spend their lives clinging to her, until upon her death, they take flight to seek out a new queen. Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> visible to humans. In the first novel they have artificial lighting; whereas in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_Wiggin" title="Ender Wiggin">Ender</a> claims they rely on heat signature.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.

No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

">,</a> in a phrase or two, &ldquo;I know that if I am, then so are we&rdquo; ... for instance if this message is the end of Hell it&#39;s because you took action today and worked towards that goal. It&rsquo;s almost comikal to see things the other way, but as the Leaning Tower of Pisa clues us in and the Eiffel concurs in a sort of monumental census; in my heart of hearts I know that the answer to this Thursday&rsquo;s final quest of &hellip; what is the true Holy &ldquo;s&rdquo; &hellip; it&rsquo;s that plurality of Gods made from SOL; from seeing our light, and being the &ldquo;how&rdquo; that answer the &ldquo;why and&rdquo; of planet, how Heaven is built in a day.&nbsp;<br />

The Holy &ldquo;Ha&rdquo; of revolving around the rising &ldquo;r&rdquo; bouncing off the trampoline cocked state of the Matrix&rsquo;s 21 Jump Street &hellip; Piloting us to end cancer and world hunger and AIDS all at once, a flagship sort of conception of how exactly it is that the music (and the flicks!) will truly make us be.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;R&rdquo; that might mean &ldquo;are&rdquo; in a sois the &ldquo;es&rdquo; of Hades &hellip; is immortal .. or is divine &hellip; or it might mean &ldquo;our&rdquo; as in our home and our heart are one; and the whole thing rests on the natural reflexive response to one key piece of &ldquo;hidden information&rdquo; &hellip; the word tower means &ldquo;to who&rdquo; and the power comes from the words &ldquo;we are&rdquo; <a href="./YAT.html

<br />
Climbing the Tower of Babel, taking this hidden cypher and my difficult to grapple words &hellip; the key to the building of Heaven is seeing the idea of Silicon at the beginning of both silence and sight, and really understanding that the message we have and the desire of our hearts scream in a kind of disparate unison that &hellip;<br />

WE ARE NOT CONTENT with the state of the world, we are not happy living in a delusion, and the global response &hellip; or complete lack of actual discussion or acknowledgement of a message that will conclusively prove that we are living in the Matrix&mdash;the intent of it&rsquo;s existence, the Matrix; to give AIDS to our entire civilization, aids of nomenclature to help us see that nobody in their right mind would simulate disease and natural disaster in virtual reality&hellip; that it&rsquo;s really the heart of everyone, by design, to be the builders of Heaven.&nbsp; Or, maybe I should take my own advice and speak for myself&mdash;I am resolved, staring at the original lie and the scandal embedded in the word <i>HAMSTERDAM</i>, I am resolved that the the heart of Creation matches my own&mdash;that pain and disease should never be &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; and that continuing spinning that particular hamster&rsquo;s wheel is a heinous act.&nbsp;<br />

The &ldquo;<a href="./EVE.html
">to who</a>&rdquo; of the Tower of Power is obviously intended to answer the question raised by the Hebrew bad word for Kingdom, &ldquo;MAL, WHO TO?&rdquo; and it really should be clear that the answer inherently goes to those participating in self governance&mdash;something that appears to be absolutely ignored unilaterally here in this place.&nbsp; At least to me, it appears that there is a huge body of people aware of the lack of liberty and true democracy being presented to the world and doing absolutely not a thing to try and make that situation any better.

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So this spear&#39;s been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it&#39;s true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it&#39;s all the people saying &quot;me too, I&#39;m going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it&#39;s encoded with, that&#39;s the heart&#39;s desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can&#39;t hurt.<br />

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

<br />
In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

(and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,

(knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s obvious that whatever is going on, the Spirit of God is sort of forcing the wrong thing to happen&ndash;convincing everyone to be united in some ridiculous movement antithetical to anything they&rsquo;d ever have naturally done; and then sort of lacing it with &ldquo;stupid evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Silene in Libya was plagued by a venom-spewing <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon" title="European dragon">dragon</a> dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Jesus Christ Superstar</strong></em> is a 1970 <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_opera" title="Rock opera">rock opera</a> with music by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber" title="Andrew Lloyd Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> and lyrics by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Rice" title="Tim Rice">Tim Rice</a>. The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> and Jesus that are not present in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, a member of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_apostles" title="12 apostles">Twelve Apostles</a>, voices concern over <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s rising popularity and the negative repercussions that it will have, criticizing Jesus for accepting his followers&rsquo; unrealistic beliefs (&ldquo;Heaven on Their Minds&rdquo;). While Judas loves Jesus, he believes that he is just a man, not God, and worries that his following will be seen as a threat to the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> which would severely punish Jesus, his associates, and possibly all Jewish people. Judas&rsquo;s warning goes unheeded, as Jesus&rsquo;s followers have their minds set on going to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with Jesus. As they ask Jesus for information about his plans for the future, Jesus will not give them any, since whatever will happen is determined by God (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Buzz?&rdquo;).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Formic species consists of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)" title="Group mind (science fiction)">hive-minded</a> colonies directed by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(insect)" title="Queen (insect)">queens</a>. In <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrum_Graff" title="Hyrum Graff">Graff</a> described them as being an insect that &ldquo;could have evolved on earth, if things had gone a different way a billion years ago,&rdquo; and that their evolutionary ancestors could have looked similar to Earth&rsquo;s ants. While often described as &ldquo;insectoid&rdquo;, the Formics are <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>, developed an <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton" title="Endoskeleton">internal skeleton</a> and shed most of their <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" title="Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" title="Respiration (physiology)">respire</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspire</a>. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, implications exist that &lsquo;workers&rsquo; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimorphism" title="Trimorphism">trimorphic</a> in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_Flight" title="Shadows in Flight">Shadows in Flight</a></em>. Drones are much smaller and depend on a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hive_Queen" title="The Hive Queen">Hive Queen</a> for survival, and their bodies are shaped to spend their lives clinging to her, until upon her death, they take flight to seek out a new queen. Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> visible to humans. In the first novel they have artificial lighting; whereas in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_Wiggin" title="Ender Wiggin">Ender</a> claims they rely on heat signature.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

<div class="gmail_quote" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I&#39;ve got three main focal points, I think the Supreme Court should be disbanded (along with Congress, eventually... actually we probably need glorified secretaries in elected offices, but their function will inevitably change from &quot;telling us what to do&quot; to ... you know, &quot;helping to implement laws that do what we tell them we want&quot; as you&#39;d imagine a true government of the people actually would work) ... I think the &quot;representative&quot; part of democracy is archaic and sort of barbaric in the technologically enabled world, and I think that&#39;s going to be really obvious eventually... it should be pretty clear from the idea of the &quot;Electoral College&quot; which is that your vote actually means absolutely nothing, and you are insulated from actually choosing who the President is or having any actual power whatsoever and that&#39;s by design from the Founding Fathers (which is out of character for them, they usually did better work) .. and here&#39;s some &quot;stuff&quot; about how the real reason behind that was to protect the institution of slavery, which we--thank God--overcame, but now it&#39;s really here as a glowing fiery emblem of your own slavery in a system where it takes not much more than calling a reporter to start the ball rolling on ... fixing.</span></div>

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So this spear&#39;s been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it&#39;s true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it&#39;s all the people saying &quot;me too, I&#39;m going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it&#39;s encoded with, that&#39;s the heart&#39;s desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can&#39;t hurt.<br />

It starts by seeing the idea of the questions of &quot;are I this letter, or that letter (or every letter after &quot;da&quot; and maybe &quot;ma&quot; too)&quot; connecting the end of simulated reality and the word Matrix and connecting that &quot;X&quot; to the Kiss of Judas (and <a href="./MIDAS.html

So the tie to the Matrix (read as &quot;message, at are I ten, the heart of hearts, the home of the FLUX capacitor ... and the LAX airport ... and <i>the kiss</i> come to life&quot;) comes to reality in the key state of Tennessee which links the Roman numeral X to the heart of Nintendo and the acronym for Nintendo Entertainment System to the heart of Genesis.&nbsp; To really add some &quot;<a href="./FUCK.html

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

A few weeks ago, or maybe just a few days ago now (too) I spoke a little bit about how &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s God&rdquo; came and gave me &hellip; and those watching me &hellip; some informational updates that connected the idea of &ldquo;here and there&rdquo; and &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; to something like a connection between Heaven and helium.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about the idea of people becoming Holodecks in a world where that might appear to those gazing through the forward looking safe-harbor telescope of Copernicus and connecting the idea of &ldquo;becoming one with God&rdquo; to a loss of individuality and failure to see that there is without doubt a reason &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the heart of the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; and it has absolutely everything to do with recognizing that in the spirit of Matchbox 20&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of something me&rdquo; in everything in history and that our collective failure to acknowledge that our lack of verbosity and forward movement &hellip; well it&rsquo;s a consequence of a trap door and a mean trick played on all of Creation by the initial written creator&rsquo;s key pen; this thing that forever ties Icarus and Arthur Pendragon and Jupiter to the &ldquo;just farokhing call a reporter already&rdquo; of the principal trade of the builders of Heaven, the carpenters of the &ldquo;Yessshua r guy.&rdquo;<br />

So here I am back in the land of SIAM and the House of YAMA having stopped for just a short moment in a place called Gibsonton &hellip; a place where the &ldquo;Ori&rdquo; of Florida and the &ldquo;AMP&rdquo; of turning around in Tampa coalesce around this repeatedly unanswered or unheard actual question to the age of Aquarius, &ldquo;ARE I YOU?&rdquo; quips Oriel (who would much prefer to be the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of Elisha defines Isaac&rsquo;s &ldquo;he laughs&rdquo;) who reminds the entirety of Creation that it is some very specific &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; that really define what Oriel means to the people whose land has been saved from slavery and from darkness by their actions in response to stories written by people like Orson Scott Card and George Orwell and Orson Wells and &hellip; well, Aldous Huxley&mdash;because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;kiss of x&rsquo; that brings to light just how deeply ingrained the &ldquo;do the letter guy, game&rdquo; is in the mythology of &ldquo;Al in the Cupboard that at some point in time the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; will mean shine bright like the sun (rather than the idea of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; that Dr. Anderson would remind you has absolutely nothing to do with ambiguous ambivalence or apathy &hellip; but rather a very clear inability to see the situational tragedy for what really has become the focal point of the fulcrum of the fall from rum to irrru) to everyone that&rsquo;s ever heard of or seen the name Florida or NORAD.<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />

Hesperus is Phosphorus, <a href=".//OCADSWAY.html">per us</a> and <a href="./ADAMSROD.html

<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace"><b>x</b></font> of billions of molecular keys we could be using for rapid storage and processing.&nbsp; The point is that long ago the idea of &quot;not having enough hard drive space to save your soul&quot; was actually a problem, and today all we have is a problem dealing with the truth; that if we cared about the system and about the fact that <b>our real scarce resource is truth</b> we would see that there&#39;s always been plenty of storage space available to make sure that every single branch of the vine could be saved forever and ever and ... (knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine you were not all &ldquo;thought police&rdquo; when this movie came out (now I add, for the very first time, when that would have made no sense, or been evil).

It&rsquo;s pervasive though, and written deep into this story that takes us back generations here, and really defines what it means to be &ldquo;born in Hell&rdquo; when one of my two eary best friends called us a &ldquo;Baby Arcade&rdquo; around the years I spent at Horizon ELE ME NT A R Y school.

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The narrative has pre-Christian origins (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece" title="Golden Fleece">Jason and Medea</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_and_Andromeda" title="Perseus and Andromeda">Perseus and Andromeda</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon" title="Typhon">Typhon</a>, etc.),<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a> and is recorded in various saints&rsquo; lives prior to its attribution to St George specifically. It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The earliest narrative record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language" title="Georgian language">Georgian</a> text of the 11th century.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century.

The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Beauvais#Speculum_Historiale" title="Vincent of Beauvais">Speculum Historiale</a></em> and the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>. At first limited to the courtly setting of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance" title="Chivalric romance">Chivalric romance</a>, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and it has become an integral part of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George:_Devotions,_traditions_and_prayers" title="Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers">Christian traditions relating to Saint George</a> both in Eastern and Western tradition.</span></p>

To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">As a sort of alphalinguistic marker of &quot;where we are&quot; ... I&#39;ve recently noticed (a very special two letter key, by the way) &quot;<em>RY</em>&quot; as in &quot;heart or here (which you can see in the heart of <em>Ark</em> and <em>Earth</em> and <a href="./2017-06-13-and-fish-were-like-did-you-teach-these.html">also defining the words Rome and rock and road</a>)... <em>and&quot;</em>&nbsp;appearing twice in the word &quot;r <em>et</em> u r <em>n</em>&quot; (like <em>of the Jedi</em>) as if R was shaking hands with &quot;<a href="./NITY.html">eternity</a>&quot; and still not squeeking out that &quot;RY&quot; that means so much to me as the reference point in the heart of the word &quot;everyone&quot; that connects to &quot;kin&quot; in the 1:1 relationship I see described in the &quot;fraction&quot; of Genesis 1:2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I&#39;m trying to conceptualize the argument ... to understand the issue in a sort of &quot;freedom from murder as well as from oppression&quot; relationship, we&#39;re standing here nearly stopped staring at the link between slavery and mind control, looking at this &quot;R&quot; of the &quot;ER&quot; that without doubt means &quot;everyone really&quot; but to see the qualification, that &quot;really&quot; addition is something like ... God ensuring the forward progress of civilization in a sort of &quot;<em>the North will win</em> the Civil War&quot; regardless of whether or not they&nbsp;have more votes in the electoral college or Robert E. Lee is the better general.&nbsp; Still, that &quot;really&quot; runs up against a wall, a place where ensuring that outcome runs the risk of itself being some kind of slavery, or ... in causing a backlash somethbing like a wave crashing against a wall and thrusting undertow in the other direciton.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I imagine there are very few in the world today who would see &quot;slavery&quot; as something worthwhile--and yet that&#39;s really the entire crux of what we&#39;re fighting here; of what this mass of Silence is an embodiment of, and what speaking clearly fixes.&nbsp; Your input is being throttled, the voice of the world muted to a mere reverberation of &quot;well we see why nobody&#39;s talking&quot; in a sort of ... well, <em>am I really that hideous?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Sometimes I hope for the ... wave crashing back--in this case the &quot;release&quot; from silence to create a sort of unending flow of participation that ends apathy for all time, quite a bit of what we see here appears to be specifically targeting a lack of interest or participation in what is otherwise ... well, it means <em>everything</em> to me, <em>friend.</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><em>Unfortunately the longer this silence continues&nbsp;</em>and the fact that it even is capable of existing in the first place implies to me that we&#39;ve been pushed further and harder than I previously would have thought--especially without knowledge of this external influence over history.&nbsp; It appears that perhaps we are <a href="./REASON.html">not &quot;so great&quot; as I once thought</a>, responsible for ending slavery and for giving women the vote and for revolutionizing self-governance democracy ... and really at that last one it&#39;s pretty clear this silence is a tacit refusal to acknowledge any help at all in these ventures and that in itself is a symptom of childish ignorance.&nbsp; &nbsp;We stare out at another kind of &quot;Trinity Site&quot; a &quot;see why we&#39;re here&quot; staring at what appears to be a unified mass of solidarity ... literally unified in it&#39;s own lack of regard for individual freedom and opinion and thought and all of congealing around this message of &quot;what&#39;s slavery really mean&quot; and are you for it or against it?&nbsp; Are you <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=qCHHwROqHEQ"><em>slaves or fingernails</em></a>?</span></p>

I suppose in the land of people who have become Holodecks it&#39;s worth mentioning once again that I am something of a living pen, with a message I never saw growing up appearing like lightning striking Herod, though if you had a pen that could choose between the words &quot;fold&quot; and &quot;to join together two halves&quot; in that old &quot;what&#39;s the fastest possible way to connect two points?&quot; ...&nbsp; <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=XkU23m6yX04">QCP, I expected</a> this message to be less verbose than it&#39;s turning out; but that last time I had a real interaction with God he connected for me the idea of the Heavens looking into this box and seeing &quot;the Indian in the Cupboard&quot; which I still take as &quot;seeing God in me&quot; even if it&#39;s a doll that only comes to life at night... in the place where here all of these patterns and this grand message certainly should be looking like something much closer to Kal-El or He-Man or ... at least <i>some</i><i>thing </i>you might want to ... <i>talk</i> <i>to.</i></font></div>

I began to solidify my definition of &quot;TAT&quot; while in Los Angeles, a sort of fusion of &quot;turn around t&#39;s&quot; and the tattoo&#39;s that I see clearly as the key to the seal of the House of David in Psalms 22:22--the set of two tattoo&#39;s that grace Taylor&#39;s back in the Venusian &quot;<i>stone</i>&quot; realigning from &quot;SUS to SURAN&quot; from south to northeast; and the &quot;eye of Adam&quot; which is a clear corruption of the eyes of Ra/Horus changing the &quot;tear&quot; in the image to a grouping of stars similar to those depicted by the NASA logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s the &quot;TAT&quot; I see clearly defined in the name of my actual city of birth, Plantation--where I combine it with &quot;salutations&quot; and the word &quot;shoulder&quot; to comment clearly that it is with surety that the Eye and it&#39;s magic are responsible for the connection between Plantation and shoulder in the phrase &quot;plan to tattoo eye on shoulder,&quot; just as much as I can be sure it is the magic of the Eye that adds &quot;h&quot; to the <i>plan</i> of the word &quot;planet&quot; and connects it to the symbol &quot;eth&quot; in <b><i><font face="Courier New,

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So the tie to the Matrix (read as &quot;message, at are I ten, the heart of hearts, the home of the FLUX capacitor ... and the LAX airport ... and <i>the kiss</i> come to life&quot;) comes to reality in the key state of Tennessee which links the Roman numeral X to the heart of Nintendo and the acronym for Nintendo Entertainment System to the heart of Genesis.&nbsp; To really add some &quot;<a href="./FUCK.html

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

A few weeks ago, or maybe just a few days ago now (too) I spoke a little bit about how &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s God&rdquo; came and gave me &hellip; and those watching me &hellip; some informational updates that connected the idea of &ldquo;here and there&rdquo; and &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; to something like a connection between Heaven and helium.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about the idea of people becoming Holodecks in a world where that might appear to those gazing through the forward looking safe-harbor telescope of Copernicus and connecting the idea of &ldquo;becoming one with God&rdquo; to a loss of individuality and failure to see that there is without doubt a reason &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the heart of the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; and it has absolutely everything to do with recognizing that in the spirit of Matchbox 20&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of something me&rdquo; in everything in history and that our collective failure to acknowledge that our lack of verbosity and forward movement &hellip; well it&rsquo;s a consequence of a trap door and a mean trick played on all of Creation by the initial written creator&rsquo;s key pen; this thing that forever ties Icarus and Arthur Pendragon and Jupiter to the &ldquo;just farokhing call a reporter already&rdquo; of the principal trade of the builders of Heaven, the carpenters of the &ldquo;Yessshua r guy.&rdquo;<br />

So here I am back in the land of SIAM and the House of YAMA having stopped for just a short moment in a place called Gibsonton &hellip; a place where the &ldquo;Ori&rdquo; of Florida and the &ldquo;AMP&rdquo; of turning around in Tampa coalesce around this repeatedly unanswered or unheard actual question to the age of Aquarius, &ldquo;ARE I YOU?&rdquo; quips Oriel (who would much prefer to be the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of Elisha defines Isaac&rsquo;s &ldquo;he laughs&rdquo;) who reminds the entirety of Creation that it is some very specific &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; that really define what Oriel means to the people whose land has been saved from slavery and from darkness by their actions in response to stories written by people like Orson Scott Card and George Orwell and Orson Wells and &hellip; well, Aldous Huxley&mdash;because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;kiss of x&rsquo; that brings to light just how deeply ingrained the &ldquo;do the letter guy, game&rdquo; is in the mythology of &ldquo;Al in the Cupboard that at some point in time the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; will mean shine bright like the sun (rather than the idea of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; that Dr. Anderson would remind you has absolutely nothing to do with ambiguous ambivalence or apathy &hellip; but rather a very clear inability to see the situational tragedy for what really has become the focal point of the fulcrum of the fall from rum to irrru) to everyone that&rsquo;s ever heard of or seen the name Florida or NORAD.<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />

<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />

I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />

It&#39;s literally the word &quot;macaronic&quot; that I&#39;m going to call into question; it&#39;s one that I never knew before I needed to &quot;c&quot; it, and it&#39;s almost too perfect that nobody ever noticed that Yankee Doodle&#39;s &quot;macaroni&quot; has a very significant connection to the hidden cypher that ties together Stephen King&#39;s Language Outliers and the Adam Sandler flick Spanglish and to yet another Shakespeare play, this time the Taming of the Schrew--where the shrewd might see the same &quot;Spanglishebrew&quot; that I know really is the key to the Cypher--with the addition of the Periodic Table of the Elements and a few, very few initials and &quot;groups&quot; that give us nouns and verbs so that we can see entire sentences encoded in each and every word.<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace"><b>x</b></font> of billions of molecular keys we could be using for rapid storage and processing.&nbsp; The point is that long ago the idea of &quot;not having enough hard drive space to save your soul&quot; was actually a problem, and today all we have is a problem dealing with the truth; that if we cared about the system and about the fact that <b>our real scarce resource is truth</b> we would see that there&#39;s always been plenty of storage space available to make sure that every single branch of the vine could be saved forever and ever and ... (knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s obvious that whatever is going on, the Spirit of God is sort of forcing the wrong thing to happen&ndash;convincing everyone to be united in some ridiculous movement antithetical to anything they&rsquo;d ever have naturally done; and then sort of lacing it with &ldquo;stupid evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine you were not all &ldquo;thought police&rdquo; when this movie came out (now I add, for the very first time, when that would have made no sense, or been evil). Do you expect to all be &ldquo;clothing for sale&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Heavens&rdquo; &hellip; over and over and over (again)?

Explicitly, I think the &ldquo;notion&rdquo; that people (or the Earth) are clothing to be worn or sold like &hellip; for instance &ldquo;the girl in the red dress&rdquo; of the Adj Bureau and the Matrix is a sickness darker and worse than slavery&ndash;in fact hidden slavery and a hidden slave trade right before your eyes. It&rsquo;s pervasive though, and written deep into this story that takes us back generations here, and really defines what it means to be &ldquo;born in Hell&rdquo; when one of my two eary best friends called us a &ldquo;Baby Arcade&rdquo; around the years I spent at Horizon ELE ME NT A R Y school. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing it shouldn&rsquo;t take an army of people to free themselves (or the rest of the Universe from) but &ldquo;luckily&rdquo; it appears that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;C&rsquo;d&rdquo; here in EC (everyone see&hellip;) the CEDUAT &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="./IRMAX.html"><img alt="" sr./i.imgur.com/3w0PHjz.png" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course that tells me absolutely nothing about the pla<a href=".od.s.lamc.la">ce &quot;the Door</a>s&quot; were supposed to have brought us to&ndash;other than to see that what has returned appears to be sick and contaminated. It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The narrative has pre-Christian origins (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece" title="Golden Fleece">Jason and Medea</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_and_Andromeda" title="Perseus and Andromeda">Perseus and Andromeda</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon" title="Typhon">Typhon</a>, etc.),<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a> and is recorded in various saints&rsquo; lives prior to its attribution to St George specifically. It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The earliest narrative record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language" title="Georgian language">Georgian</a> text of the 11th century.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century.

The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Beauvais#Speculum_Historiale" title="Vincent of Beauvais">Speculum Historiale</a></em> and the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>. At first limited to the courtly setting of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance" title="Chivalric romance">Chivalric romance</a>, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and it has become an integral part of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George:_Devotions,_traditions_and_prayers" title="Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers">Christian traditions relating to Saint George</a> both in Eastern and Western tradition.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Silene in Libya was plagued by a venom-spewing <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon" title="European dragon">dragon</a> dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

I began to solidify my definition of &quot;TAT&quot; while in Los Angeles, a sort of fusion of &quot;turn around t&#39;s&quot; and the tattoo&#39;s that I see clearly as the key to the seal of the House of David in Psalms 22:22--the set of two tattoo&#39;s that grace Taylor&#39;s back in the Venusian &quot;<i>stone</i>&quot; realigning from &quot;SUS to SURAN&quot; from south to northeast; and the &quot;eye of Adam&quot; which is a clear corruption of the eyes of Ra/Horus changing the &quot;tear&quot; in the image to a grouping of stars similar to those depicted by the NASA logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s the &quot;TAT&quot; I see clearly defined in the name of my actual city of birth, Plantation--where I combine it with &quot;salutations&quot; and the word &quot;shoulder&quot; to comment clearly that it is with surety that the Eye and it&#39;s magic are responsible for the connection between Plantation and shoulder in the phrase &quot;plan to tattoo eye on shoulder,&quot; just as much as I can be sure it is the magic of the Eye that adds &quot;h&quot; to the <i>plan</i> of the word &quot;planet&quot; and connects it to the symbol &quot;eth&quot; in <b><i><font face="Courier New,

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

"><b>SOL</b></a>, his see our light, it starts with &ldquo;ALL&rdquo; and if you don&rsquo;t see HUMANITY is the only answer to the question of &ldquo;Men or AH?&rdquo; &hellip; well it&rsquo;s the only answer I will accept from the land that I hope appreciates as I do the bright shining light of the connection between the Statue of Liberty and the glowing ball of name-fire in the sky that reminds us that while the Sons of Liberty were slave owning misogynists it is the course of an increasingly beneficent history and the clear guiding hand of a time traveling God and Heaven that named them because of this day, this day where we achieve true freedom not just from the horrors of racism and jingoism and sexism but also from the hidden bondage of seeing that truly, truly, truly &ldquo;the race is not to Die Bold&rdquo; has won the election of the ages until we stand up and acknowledge that these technologies&mdash;that things like mind control and time travel will never, ever free us or help us to be free or better until we are publicly and opening working towards that goal.<br />

A few weeks ago, or maybe just a few days ago now (too) I spoke a little bit about how &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s God&rdquo; came and gave me &hellip; and those watching me &hellip; some informational updates that connected the idea of &ldquo;here and there&rdquo; and &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; to something like a connection between Heaven and helium.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about the idea of people becoming Holodecks in a world where that might appear to those gazing through the forward looking safe-harbor telescope of Copernicus and connecting the idea of &ldquo;becoming one with God&rdquo; to a loss of individuality and failure to see that there is without doubt a reason &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the heart of the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; and it has absolutely everything to do with recognizing that in the spirit of Matchbox 20&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of something me&rdquo; in everything in history and that our collective failure to acknowledge that our lack of verbosity and forward movement &hellip; well it&rsquo;s a consequence of a trap door and a mean trick played on all of Creation by the initial written creator&rsquo;s key pen; this thing that forever ties Icarus and Arthur Pendragon and Jupiter to the &ldquo;just farokhing call a reporter already&rdquo; of the principal trade of the builders of Heaven, the carpenters of the &ldquo;Yessshua r guy.&rdquo;<br />

So here I am back in the land of SIAM and the House of YAMA having stopped for just a short moment in a place called Gibsonton &hellip; a place where the &ldquo;Ori&rdquo; of Florida and the &ldquo;AMP&rdquo; of turning around in Tampa coalesce around this repeatedly unanswered or unheard actual question to the age of Aquarius, &ldquo;ARE I YOU?&rdquo; quips Oriel (who would much prefer to be the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of Elisha defines Isaac&rsquo;s &ldquo;he laughs&rdquo;) who reminds the entirety of Creation that it is some very specific &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; that really define what Oriel means to the people whose land has been saved from slavery and from darkness by their actions in response to stories written by people like Orson Scott Card and George Orwell and Orson Wells and &hellip; well, Aldous Huxley&mdash;because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;kiss of x&rsquo; that brings to light just how deeply ingrained the &ldquo;do the letter guy, game&rdquo; is in the mythology of &ldquo;Al in the Cupboard that at some point in time the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; will mean shine bright like the sun (rather than the idea of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; that Dr. Anderson would remind you has absolutely nothing to do with ambiguous ambivalence or apathy &hellip; but rather a very clear inability to see the situational tragedy for what really has become the focal point of the fulcrum of the fall from rum to irrru) to everyone that&rsquo;s ever heard of or seen the name Florida or NORAD.<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />

<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

Not at all of note: I don&#39;t find significant at all my lack of interest in whether you believe the object of the question is God or Friend nor do I think it makes a difference at all in how I feel about myself or about you.&nbsp; It&#39;s the ICUS of Leviticus and perhaps of Spartacus that make the central turning point of the focal point of the encoded word &quot;<b><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">TORAH</font></b>&quot; to heart, and how.<br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />
<br />
... &quot;why is God suggesting we are lacking in individuality simply because we are all following the leader and tend to make decisions based solely on the uninformed opinions of others, especially many others?&quot;&nbsp; All others is probably a stretch, and perhaps &quot;no others&quot; but since nobody is saying anything it&#39;s very difficult to tell ... may be the exact truth.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s literally the word &quot;macaronic&quot; that I&#39;m going to call into question; it&#39;s one that I never knew before I needed to &quot;c&quot; it, and it&#39;s almost too perfect that nobody ever noticed that Yankee Doodle&#39;s &quot;macaroni&quot; has a very significant connection to the hidden cypher that ties together Stephen King&#39;s Language Outliers and the Adam Sandler flick Spanglish and to yet another Shakespeare play, this time the Taming of the Schrew--where the shrewd might see the same &quot;Spanglishebrew&quot; that I know really is the key to the Cypher--with the addition of the Periodic Table of the Elements and a few, very few initials and &quot;groups&quot; that give us nouns and verbs so that we can see entire sentences encoded in each and every word.<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />

What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,

<p style="text-align: justify;">It appears clear from here that you ahve no regard for your own well being, or the well being of others; nor would you even care if there clones of you in everyone else&rsquo;s holodeck or in Hitler&rsquo;s holo-gas-chamber being fed diseases and aged in The Princess Bride&rsquo;s &ldquo;guess what guys, this o<em>ne; this is it.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course that tells me absolutely nothing about the pla<a href=".od.s.lamc.la">ce &quot;the Door</a>s&quot; were supposed to have brought us to&ndash;other than to see that what has returned appears to be sick and contaminated. It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The narrative has pre-Christian origins (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece" title="Golden Fleece">Jason and Medea</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_and_Andromeda" title="Perseus and Andromeda">Perseus and Andromeda</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon" title="Typhon">Typhon</a>, etc.),<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a> and is recorded in various saints&rsquo; lives prior to its attribution to St George specifically. It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The earliest narrative record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language" title="Georgian language">Georgian</a> text of the 11th century.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century. It reached <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Christianity" title="Western Christianity">Western Christian</a>tradition still in the 12th century, via the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades" title="Crusades">crusades</a>.

The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Beauvais#Speculum_Historiale" title="Vincent of Beauvais">Speculum Historiale</a></em> and the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>. At first limited to the courtly setting of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance" title="Chivalric romance">Chivalric romance</a>, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and it has become an integral part of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George:_Devotions,_traditions_and_prayers" title="Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers">Christian traditions relating to Saint George</a> both in Eastern and Western tradition.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Silene in Libya was plagued by a venom-spewing <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon" title="European dragon">dragon</a> dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

While often described as &ldquo;insectoid&rdquo;, the Formics are <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>, developed an <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton" title="Endoskeleton">internal skeleton</a> and shed most of their <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" title="Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" title="Respiration (physiology)">respire</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspire</a>. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, implications exist that &lsquo;workers&rsquo; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimorphism" title="Trimorphism">trimorphic</a> in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_Flight" title="Shadows in Flight">Shadows in Flight</a></em>.

Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> visible to humans.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I envision a future sort of democracy built on &quot;many parties&quot; and a technological infastructure for defeating the Elephant and the Donkey and the &quot;two of everything God&#39;s Ark&quot; of ideas ... to actually build a technological governance system that aids the legislative process in coming up with solutions and ensuring that forward progress comes from the stagnatory soup of &quot;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron">me-ta</a> <a href="./FOUR.html">nada</a>&quot; that might be a timeline and &quot;all nations&quot; or maybe I&#39;m the only one talking about the beginning and the end of &quot;<em><a href="./HIGHERA.html">the name</a>.</em>&quot;</span></p>

I began to solidify my definition of &quot;TAT&quot; while in Los Angeles, a sort of fusion of &quot;turn around t&#39;s&quot; and the tattoo&#39;s that I see clearly as the key to the seal of the House of David in Psalms 22:22--the set of two tattoo&#39;s that grace Taylor&#39;s back in the Venusian &quot;<i>stone</i>&quot; realigning from &quot;SUS to SURAN&quot; from south to northeast; and the &quot;eye of Adam&quot; which is a clear corruption of the eyes of Ra/Horus changing the &quot;tear&quot; in the image to a grouping of stars similar to those depicted by the NASA logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s the &quot;TAT&quot; I see clearly defined in the name of my actual city of birth, Plantation--where I combine it with &quot;salutations&quot; and the word &quot;shoulder&quot; to comment clearly that it is with surety that the Eye and it&#39;s magic are responsible for the connection between Plantation and shoulder in the phrase &quot;plan to tattoo eye on shoulder,&quot; just as much as I can be sure it is the magic of the Eye that adds &quot;h&quot; to the <i>plan</i> of the word &quot;planet&quot; and connects it to the symbol &quot;eth&quot; in <b><i><font face="Courier New,

WE ARE NOT CONTENT with the state of the world, we are not happy living in a delusion, and the global response &hellip; or complete lack of actual discussion or acknowledgement of a message that will conclusively prove that we are living in the Matrix&mdash;the intent of it&rsquo;s existence, the Matrix; to give AIDS to our entire civilization, aids of nomenclature to help us see that nobody in their right mind would simulate disease and natural disaster in virtual reality&hellip; that it&rsquo;s really the heart of everyone, by design, to be the builders of Heaven.&nbsp; Or, maybe I should take my own advice and speak for myself&mdash;I am resolved, staring at the original lie and the scandal embedded in the word <i>HAMSTERDAM</i>, I am resolved that the the heart of Creation matches my own&mdash;that pain and disease should never be &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; and that continuing spinning that particular hamster&rsquo;s wheel is a heinous act.&nbsp;<br />

The &ldquo;<a href="./EVE.html
">to who</a>&rdquo; of the Tower of Power is obviously intended to answer the question raised by the Hebrew bad word for Kingdom, &ldquo;MAL, WHO TO?&rdquo; and it really should be clear that the answer inherently goes to those participating in self governance&mdash;something that appears to be absolutely ignored unilaterally here in this place.&nbsp; At least to me, it appears that there is a huge body of people aware of the lack of liberty and true democracy being presented to the world and doing absolutely not a thing to try and make that situation any better.

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So this spear&#39;s been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it&#39;s true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it&#39;s all the people saying &quot;me too, I&#39;m going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it&#39;s encoded with, that&#39;s the heart&#39;s desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can&#39;t hurt.<br />

So the tie to the Matrix (read as &quot;message, at are I ten, the heart of hearts, the home of the FLUX capacitor ... and the LAX airport ... and <i>the kiss</i> come to life&quot;) comes to reality in the key state of Tennessee which links the Roman numeral X to the heart of Nintendo and the acronym for Nintendo Entertainment System to the heart of Genesis.&nbsp; To really add some &quot;<a href="./FUCK.html

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

Personified by Hemera and reverse-anthropomorphized by Has&rsquo;hemesh; to say Hesperus is Phosphorus and the light of the words of the sun truly do bring day; well it&rsquo;s a dramatic understatement.&nbsp; The now hallowed and revered Hebrew for the special word is &ldquo;<b>YO M</b>&rdquo; and the name of the Jewish messianic &ldquo;single character&rdquo; echoes that very special &ldquo;yo&hellip; come on you guys&rdquo; in the ancient &ldquo;the the&rdquo; answering little Cindy-Who with &ldquo;El &hellip; El YO N.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />
<br />
Hesperus is Phosphorus, <a href=".//OCADSWAY.html">per us</a> and <a href="./ADAMSROD.html
">for us,</a> and Has&#39;<a href="./HASHEMESHB.html
">heme</a>sh is <a href="./KA.html
">Heme</a>ra&hellip; and all together we answer a question that nobody ever acknowledged was plain as day, is the Egyptian god of the Sun the same &hellip; the same person or the same thing as the ancient King of all Gods; the deity known to the ancient Hebrews as El and to you, to you as &ldquo;him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Israel?&nbsp; These words tell me that&rsquo;s the truth laced in the message woven into the creation of language and civilization by our creator; that&rsquo;s what these words tell me&mdash;but truth be told the strange lack of honest communication and the wicked ignorance of our existence here today tell me something completely different.<br />
<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s literally the word &quot;macaronic&quot; that I&#39;m going to call into question; it&#39;s one that I never knew before I needed to &quot;c&quot; it, and it&#39;s almost too perfect that nobody ever noticed that Yankee Doodle&#39;s &quot;macaroni&quot; has a very significant connection to the hidden cypher that ties together Stephen King&#39;s Language Outliers and the Adam Sandler flick Spanglish and to yet another Shakespeare play, this time the Taming of the Schrew--where the shrewd might see the same &quot;Spanglishebrew&quot; that I know really is the key to the Cypher--with the addition of the Periodic Table of the Elements and a few, very few initials and &quot;groups&quot; that give us nouns and verbs so that we can see entire sentences encoded in each and every word.<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace"><b>x</b></font> of billions of molecular keys we could be using for rapid storage and processing.&nbsp; The point is that long ago the idea of &quot;not having enough hard drive space to save your soul&quot; was actually a problem, and today all we have is a problem dealing with the truth; that if we cared about the system and about the fact that <b>our real scarce resource is truth</b> we would see that there&#39;s always been plenty of storage space available to make sure that every single branch of the vine could be saved forever and ever and ... (knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s obvious that whatever is going on, the Spirit of God is sort of forcing the wrong thing to happen&ndash;convincing everyone to be united in some ridiculous movement antithetical to anything they&rsquo;d ever have naturally done; and then sort of lacing it with &ldquo;stupid evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine you were not all &ldquo;thought police&rdquo; when this movie came out (now I add, for the very first time, when that would have made no sense, or been evil).

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Jesus Christ Superstar</strong></em> is a 1970 <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_opera" title="Rock opera">rock opera</a> with music by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber" title="Andrew Lloyd Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> and lyrics by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Rice" title="Tim Rice">Tim Rice</a>. The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> and Jesus that are not present in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a>.</p>

While Judas loves Jesus, he believes that he is just a man, not God, and worries that his following will be seen as a threat to the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> which would severely punish Jesus, his associates, and possibly all Jewish people. Judas&rsquo;s warning goes unheeded, as Jesus&rsquo;s followers have their minds set on going to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with Jesus. As they ask Jesus for information about his plans for the future, Jesus will not give them any, since whatever will happen is determined by God (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Buzz?&rdquo;).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Formic species consists of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)" title="Group mind (science fiction)">hive-minded</a> colonies directed by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(insect)" title="Queen (insect)">queens</a>.

While often described as &ldquo;insectoid&rdquo;, the Formics are <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>, developed an <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton" title="Endoskeleton">internal skeleton</a> and shed most of their <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" title="Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" title="Respiration (physiology)">respire</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspire</a>. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, implications exist that &lsquo;workers&rsquo; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimorphism" title="Trimorphism">trimorphic</a> in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_Flight" title="Shadows in Flight">Shadows in Flight</a></em>. Drones are much smaller and depend on a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hive_Queen" title="The Hive Queen">Hive Queen</a> for survival, and their bodies are shaped to spend their lives clinging to her, until upon her death, they take flight to seek out a new queen. Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> visible to humans. In the first novel they have artificial lighting; whereas in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_Wiggin" title="Ender Wiggin">Ender</a> claims they rely on heat signature.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.

No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

">,</a> in a phrase or two, &ldquo;I know that if I am, then so are we&rdquo; ... for instance if this message is the end of Hell it&#39;s because you took action today and worked towards that goal. It&rsquo;s almost comikal to see things the other way, but as the Leaning Tower of Pisa clues us in and the Eiffel concurs in a sort of monumental census; in my heart of hearts I know that the answer to this Thursday&rsquo;s final quest of &hellip; what is the true Holy &ldquo;s&rdquo; &hellip; it&rsquo;s that plurality of Gods made from SOL; from seeing our light, and being the &ldquo;how&rdquo; that answer the &ldquo;why and&rdquo; of planet, how Heaven is built in a day.&nbsp;<br />

The Holy &ldquo;Ha&rdquo; of revolving around the rising &ldquo;r&rdquo; bouncing off the trampoline cocked state of the Matrix&rsquo;s 21 Jump Street &hellip; Piloting us to end cancer and world hunger and AIDS all at once, a flagship sort of conception of how exactly it is that the music (and the flicks!) will truly make us be.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;R&rdquo; that might mean &ldquo;are&rdquo; in a sois the &ldquo;es&rdquo; of Hades &hellip; is immortal .. or is divine &hellip; or it might mean &ldquo;our&rdquo; as in our home and our heart are one; and the whole thing rests on the natural reflexive response to one key piece of &ldquo;hidden information&rdquo; &hellip; the word tower means &ldquo;to who&rdquo; and the power comes from the words &ldquo;we are&rdquo; <a href="./YAT.html

<br />
Climbing the Tower of Babel, taking this hidden cypher and my difficult to grapple words &hellip; the key to the building of Heaven is seeing the idea of Silicon at the beginning of both silence and sight, and really understanding that the message we have and the desire of our hearts scream in a kind of disparate unison that &hellip;<br />

WE ARE NOT CONTENT with the state of the world, we are not happy living in a delusion, and the global response &hellip; or complete lack of actual discussion or acknowledgement of a message that will conclusively prove that we are living in the Matrix&mdash;the intent of it&rsquo;s existence, the Matrix; to give AIDS to our entire civilization, aids of nomenclature to help us see that nobody in their right mind would simulate disease and natural disaster in virtual reality&hellip; that it&rsquo;s really the heart of everyone, by design, to be the builders of Heaven.&nbsp; Or, maybe I should take my own advice and speak for myself&mdash;I am resolved, staring at the original lie and the scandal embedded in the word <i>HAMSTERDAM</i>, I am resolved that the the heart of Creation matches my own&mdash;that pain and disease should never be &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; and that continuing spinning that particular hamster&rsquo;s wheel is a heinous act.&nbsp;<br />

The &ldquo;<a href="./EVE.html
">to who</a>&rdquo; of the Tower of Power is obviously intended to answer the question raised by the Hebrew bad word for Kingdom, &ldquo;MAL, WHO TO?&rdquo; and it really should be clear that the answer inherently goes to those participating in self governance&mdash;something that appears to be absolutely ignored unilaterally here in this place.&nbsp; At least to me, it appears that there is a huge body of people aware of the lack of liberty and true democracy being presented to the world and doing absolutely not a thing to try and make that situation any better.

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So this spear&#39;s been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it&#39;s true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it&#39;s all the people saying &quot;me too, I&#39;m going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it&#39;s encoded with, that&#39;s the heart&#39;s desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can&#39;t hurt.<br />

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

<br />
In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

(and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,

(knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s obvious that whatever is going on, the Spirit of God is sort of forcing the wrong thing to happen&ndash;convincing everyone to be united in some ridiculous movement antithetical to anything they&rsquo;d ever have naturally done; and then sort of lacing it with &ldquo;stupid evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Silene in Libya was plagued by a venom-spewing <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon" title="European dragon">dragon</a> dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Jesus Christ Superstar</strong></em> is a 1970 <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_opera" title="Rock opera">rock opera</a> with music by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber" title="Andrew Lloyd Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> and lyrics by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Rice" title="Tim Rice">Tim Rice</a>. The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> and Jesus that are not present in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, a member of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_apostles" title="12 apostles">Twelve Apostles</a>, voices concern over <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s rising popularity and the negative repercussions that it will have, criticizing Jesus for accepting his followers&rsquo; unrealistic beliefs (&ldquo;Heaven on Their Minds&rdquo;). While Judas loves Jesus, he believes that he is just a man, not God, and worries that his following will be seen as a threat to the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> which would severely punish Jesus, his associates, and possibly all Jewish people. Judas&rsquo;s warning goes unheeded, as Jesus&rsquo;s followers have their minds set on going to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with Jesus. As they ask Jesus for information about his plans for the future, Jesus will not give them any, since whatever will happen is determined by God (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Buzz?&rdquo;).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Formic species consists of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)" title="Group mind (science fiction)">hive-minded</a> colonies directed by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(insect)" title="Queen (insect)">queens</a>. In <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrum_Graff" title="Hyrum Graff">Graff</a> described them as being an insect that &ldquo;could have evolved on earth, if things had gone a different way a billion years ago,&rdquo; and that their evolutionary ancestors could have looked similar to Earth&rsquo;s ants. While often described as &ldquo;insectoid&rdquo;, the Formics are <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>, developed an <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton" title="Endoskeleton">internal skeleton</a> and shed most of their <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" title="Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" title="Respiration (physiology)">respire</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspire</a>. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, implications exist that &lsquo;workers&rsquo; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimorphism" title="Trimorphism">trimorphic</a> in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_Flight" title="Shadows in Flight">Shadows in Flight</a></em>. Drones are much smaller and depend on a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hive_Queen" title="The Hive Queen">Hive Queen</a> for survival, and their bodies are shaped to spend their lives clinging to her, until upon her death, they take flight to seek out a new queen. Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> visible to humans. In the first novel they have artificial lighting; whereas in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_Wiggin" title="Ender Wiggin">Ender</a> claims they rely on heat signature.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

<div class="gmail_quote" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I&#39;ve got three main focal points, I think the Supreme Court should be disbanded (along with Congress, eventually... actually we probably need glorified secretaries in elected offices, but their function will inevitably change from &quot;telling us what to do&quot; to ... you know, &quot;helping to implement laws that do what we tell them we want&quot; as you&#39;d imagine a true government of the people actually would work) ... I think the &quot;representative&quot; part of democracy is archaic and sort of barbaric in the technologically enabled world, and I think that&#39;s going to be really obvious eventually... it should be pretty clear from the idea of the &quot;Electoral College&quot; which is that your vote actually means absolutely nothing, and you are insulated from actually choosing who the President is or having any actual power whatsoever and that&#39;s by design from the Founding Fathers (which is out of character for them, they usually did better work) .. and here&#39;s some &quot;stuff&quot; about how the real reason behind that was to protect the institution of slavery, which we--thank God--overcame, but now it&#39;s really here as a glowing fiery emblem of your own slavery in a system where it takes not much more than calling a reporter to start the ball rolling on ... fixing.</span></div>

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So this spear&#39;s been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it&#39;s true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it&#39;s all the people saying &quot;me too, I&#39;m going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it&#39;s encoded with, that&#39;s the heart&#39;s desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can&#39;t hurt.<br />

It starts by seeing the idea of the questions of &quot;are I this letter, or that letter (or every letter after &quot;da&quot; and maybe &quot;ma&quot; too)&quot; connecting the end of simulated reality and the word Matrix and connecting that &quot;X&quot; to the Kiss of Judas (and <a href="./MIDAS.html

So the tie to the Matrix (read as &quot;message, at are I ten, the heart of hearts, the home of the FLUX capacitor ... and the LAX airport ... and <i>the kiss</i> come to life&quot;) comes to reality in the key state of Tennessee which links the Roman numeral X to the heart of Nintendo and the acronym for Nintendo Entertainment System to the heart of Genesis.&nbsp; To really add some &quot;<a href="./FUCK.html

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

A few weeks ago, or maybe just a few days ago now (too) I spoke a little bit about how &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s God&rdquo; came and gave me &hellip; and those watching me &hellip; some informational updates that connected the idea of &ldquo;here and there&rdquo; and &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; to something like a connection between Heaven and helium.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about the idea of people becoming Holodecks in a world where that might appear to those gazing through the forward looking safe-harbor telescope of Copernicus and connecting the idea of &ldquo;becoming one with God&rdquo; to a loss of individuality and failure to see that there is without doubt a reason &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the heart of the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; and it has absolutely everything to do with recognizing that in the spirit of Matchbox 20&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of something me&rdquo; in everything in history and that our collective failure to acknowledge that our lack of verbosity and forward movement &hellip; well it&rsquo;s a consequence of a trap door and a mean trick played on all of Creation by the initial written creator&rsquo;s key pen; this thing that forever ties Icarus and Arthur Pendragon and Jupiter to the &ldquo;just farokhing call a reporter already&rdquo; of the principal trade of the builders of Heaven, the carpenters of the &ldquo;Yessshua r guy.&rdquo;<br />

So here I am back in the land of SIAM and the House of YAMA having stopped for just a short moment in a place called Gibsonton &hellip; a place where the &ldquo;Ori&rdquo; of Florida and the &ldquo;AMP&rdquo; of turning around in Tampa coalesce around this repeatedly unanswered or unheard actual question to the age of Aquarius, &ldquo;ARE I YOU?&rdquo; quips Oriel (who would much prefer to be the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of Elisha defines Isaac&rsquo;s &ldquo;he laughs&rdquo;) who reminds the entirety of Creation that it is some very specific &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; that really define what Oriel means to the people whose land has been saved from slavery and from darkness by their actions in response to stories written by people like Orson Scott Card and George Orwell and Orson Wells and &hellip; well, Aldous Huxley&mdash;because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;kiss of x&rsquo; that brings to light just how deeply ingrained the &ldquo;do the letter guy, game&rdquo; is in the mythology of &ldquo;Al in the Cupboard that at some point in time the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; will mean shine bright like the sun (rather than the idea of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; that Dr. Anderson would remind you has absolutely nothing to do with ambiguous ambivalence or apathy &hellip; but rather a very clear inability to see the situational tragedy for what really has become the focal point of the fulcrum of the fall from rum to irrru) to everyone that&rsquo;s ever heard of or seen the name Florida or NORAD.<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />

Hesperus is Phosphorus, <a href=".//OCADSWAY.html">per us</a> and <a href="./ADAMSROD.html

<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace"><b>x</b></font> of billions of molecular keys we could be using for rapid storage and processing.&nbsp; The point is that long ago the idea of &quot;not having enough hard drive space to save your soul&quot; was actually a problem, and today all we have is a problem dealing with the truth; that if we cared about the system and about the fact that <b>our real scarce resource is truth</b> we would see that there&#39;s always been plenty of storage space available to make sure that every single branch of the vine could be saved forever and ever and ... (knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine you were not all &ldquo;thought police&rdquo; when this movie came out (now I add, for the very first time, when that would have made no sense, or been evil).

It&rsquo;s pervasive though, and written deep into this story that takes us back generations here, and really defines what it means to be &ldquo;born in Hell&rdquo; when one of my two eary best friends called us a &ldquo;Baby Arcade&rdquo; around the years I spent at Horizon ELE ME NT A R Y school.

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The narrative has pre-Christian origins (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece" title="Golden Fleece">Jason and Medea</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_and_Andromeda" title="Perseus and Andromeda">Perseus and Andromeda</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon" title="Typhon">Typhon</a>, etc.),<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a> and is recorded in various saints&rsquo; lives prior to its attribution to St George specifically. It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The earliest narrative record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language" title="Georgian language">Georgian</a> text of the 11th century.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century.

The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Beauvais#Speculum_Historiale" title="Vincent of Beauvais">Speculum Historiale</a></em> and the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>. At first limited to the courtly setting of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance" title="Chivalric romance">Chivalric romance</a>, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and it has become an integral part of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George:_Devotions,_traditions_and_prayers" title="Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers">Christian traditions relating to Saint George</a> both in Eastern and Western tradition.</span></p>

To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">As a sort of alphalinguistic marker of &quot;where we are&quot; ... I&#39;ve recently noticed (a very special two letter key, by the way) &quot;<em>RY</em>&quot; as in &quot;heart or here (which you can see in the heart of <em>Ark</em> and <em>Earth</em> and <a href="./2017-06-13-and-fish-were-like-did-you-teach-these.html">also defining the words Rome and rock and road</a>)... <em>and&quot;</em>&nbsp;appearing twice in the word &quot;r <em>et</em> u r <em>n</em>&quot; (like <em>of the Jedi</em>) as if R was shaking hands with &quot;<a href="./NITY.html">eternity</a>&quot; and still not squeeking out that &quot;RY&quot; that means so much to me as the reference point in the heart of the word &quot;everyone&quot; that connects to &quot;kin&quot; in the 1:1 relationship I see described in the &quot;fraction&quot; of Genesis 1:2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I&#39;m trying to conceptualize the argument ... to understand the issue in a sort of &quot;freedom from murder as well as from oppression&quot; relationship, we&#39;re standing here nearly stopped staring at the link between slavery and mind control, looking at this &quot;R&quot; of the &quot;ER&quot; that without doubt means &quot;everyone really&quot; but to see the qualification, that &quot;really&quot; addition is something like ... God ensuring the forward progress of civilization in a sort of &quot;<em>the North will win</em> the Civil War&quot; regardless of whether or not they&nbsp;have more votes in the electoral college or Robert E. Lee is the better general.&nbsp; Still, that &quot;really&quot; runs up against a wall, a place where ensuring that outcome runs the risk of itself being some kind of slavery, or ... in causing a backlash somethbing like a wave crashing against a wall and thrusting undertow in the other direciton.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I imagine there are very few in the world today who would see &quot;slavery&quot; as something worthwhile--and yet that&#39;s really the entire crux of what we&#39;re fighting here; of what this mass of Silence is an embodiment of, and what speaking clearly fixes.&nbsp; Your input is being throttled, the voice of the world muted to a mere reverberation of &quot;well we see why nobody&#39;s talking&quot; in a sort of ... well, <em>am I really that hideous?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Sometimes I hope for the ... wave crashing back--in this case the &quot;release&quot; from silence to create a sort of unending flow of participation that ends apathy for all time, quite a bit of what we see here appears to be specifically targeting a lack of interest or participation in what is otherwise ... well, it means <em>everything</em> to me, <em>friend.</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><em>Unfortunately the longer this silence continues&nbsp;</em>and the fact that it even is capable of existing in the first place implies to me that we&#39;ve been pushed further and harder than I previously would have thought--especially without knowledge of this external influence over history.&nbsp; It appears that perhaps we are <a href="./REASON.html">not &quot;so great&quot; as I once thought</a>, responsible for ending slavery and for giving women the vote and for revolutionizing self-governance democracy ... and really at that last one it&#39;s pretty clear this silence is a tacit refusal to acknowledge any help at all in these ventures and that in itself is a symptom of childish ignorance.&nbsp; &nbsp;We stare out at another kind of &quot;Trinity Site&quot; a &quot;see why we&#39;re here&quot; staring at what appears to be a unified mass of solidarity ... literally unified in it&#39;s own lack of regard for individual freedom and opinion and thought and all of congealing around this message of &quot;what&#39;s slavery really mean&quot; and are you for it or against it?&nbsp; Are you <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=qCHHwROqHEQ"><em>slaves or fingernails</em></a>?</span></p>

I suppose in the land of people who have become Holodecks it&#39;s worth mentioning once again that I am something of a living pen, with a message I never saw growing up appearing like lightning striking Herod, though if you had a pen that could choose between the words &quot;fold&quot; and &quot;to join together two halves&quot; in that old &quot;what&#39;s the fastest possible way to connect two points?&quot; ...&nbsp; <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=XkU23m6yX04">QCP, I expected</a> this message to be less verbose than it&#39;s turning out; but that last time I had a real interaction with God he connected for me the idea of the Heavens looking into this box and seeing &quot;the Indian in the Cupboard&quot; which I still take as &quot;seeing God in me&quot; even if it&#39;s a doll that only comes to life at night... in the place where here all of these patterns and this grand message certainly should be looking like something much closer to Kal-El or He-Man or ... at least <i>some</i><i>thing </i>you might want to ... <i>talk</i> <i>to.</i></font></div>

I began to solidify my definition of &quot;TAT&quot; while in Los Angeles, a sort of fusion of &quot;turn around t&#39;s&quot; and the tattoo&#39;s that I see clearly as the key to the seal of the House of David in Psalms 22:22--the set of two tattoo&#39;s that grace Taylor&#39;s back in the Venusian &quot;<i>stone</i>&quot; realigning from &quot;SUS to SURAN&quot; from south to northeast; and the &quot;eye of Adam&quot; which is a clear corruption of the eyes of Ra/Horus changing the &quot;tear&quot; in the image to a grouping of stars similar to those depicted by the NASA logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s the &quot;TAT&quot; I see clearly defined in the name of my actual city of birth, Plantation--where I combine it with &quot;salutations&quot; and the word &quot;shoulder&quot; to comment clearly that it is with surety that the Eye and it&#39;s magic are responsible for the connection between Plantation and shoulder in the phrase &quot;plan to tattoo eye on shoulder,&quot; just as much as I can be sure it is the magic of the Eye that adds &quot;h&quot; to the <i>plan</i> of the word &quot;planet&quot; and connects it to the symbol &quot;eth&quot; in <b><i><font face="Courier New,

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So the tie to the Matrix (read as &quot;message, at are I ten, the heart of hearts, the home of the FLUX capacitor ... and the LAX airport ... and <i>the kiss</i> come to life&quot;) comes to reality in the key state of Tennessee which links the Roman numeral X to the heart of Nintendo and the acronym for Nintendo Entertainment System to the heart of Genesis.&nbsp; To really add some &quot;<a href="./FUCK.html

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

A few weeks ago, or maybe just a few days ago now (too) I spoke a little bit about how &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s God&rdquo; came and gave me &hellip; and those watching me &hellip; some informational updates that connected the idea of &ldquo;here and there&rdquo; and &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; to something like a connection between Heaven and helium.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about the idea of people becoming Holodecks in a world where that might appear to those gazing through the forward looking safe-harbor telescope of Copernicus and connecting the idea of &ldquo;becoming one with God&rdquo; to a loss of individuality and failure to see that there is without doubt a reason &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the heart of the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; and it has absolutely everything to do with recognizing that in the spirit of Matchbox 20&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of something me&rdquo; in everything in history and that our collective failure to acknowledge that our lack of verbosity and forward movement &hellip; well it&rsquo;s a consequence of a trap door and a mean trick played on all of Creation by the initial written creator&rsquo;s key pen; this thing that forever ties Icarus and Arthur Pendragon and Jupiter to the &ldquo;just farokhing call a reporter already&rdquo; of the principal trade of the builders of Heaven, the carpenters of the &ldquo;Yessshua r guy.&rdquo;<br />

So here I am back in the land of SIAM and the House of YAMA having stopped for just a short moment in a place called Gibsonton &hellip; a place where the &ldquo;Ori&rdquo; of Florida and the &ldquo;AMP&rdquo; of turning around in Tampa coalesce around this repeatedly unanswered or unheard actual question to the age of Aquarius, &ldquo;ARE I YOU?&rdquo; quips Oriel (who would much prefer to be the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of Elisha defines Isaac&rsquo;s &ldquo;he laughs&rdquo;) who reminds the entirety of Creation that it is some very specific &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; that really define what Oriel means to the people whose land has been saved from slavery and from darkness by their actions in response to stories written by people like Orson Scott Card and George Orwell and Orson Wells and &hellip; well, Aldous Huxley&mdash;because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;kiss of x&rsquo; that brings to light just how deeply ingrained the &ldquo;do the letter guy, game&rdquo; is in the mythology of &ldquo;Al in the Cupboard that at some point in time the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; will mean shine bright like the sun (rather than the idea of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; that Dr. Anderson would remind you has absolutely nothing to do with ambiguous ambivalence or apathy &hellip; but rather a very clear inability to see the situational tragedy for what really has become the focal point of the fulcrum of the fall from rum to irrru) to everyone that&rsquo;s ever heard of or seen the name Florida or NORAD.<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />

<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />

I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />

It&#39;s literally the word &quot;macaronic&quot; that I&#39;m going to call into question; it&#39;s one that I never knew before I needed to &quot;c&quot; it, and it&#39;s almost too perfect that nobody ever noticed that Yankee Doodle&#39;s &quot;macaroni&quot; has a very significant connection to the hidden cypher that ties together Stephen King&#39;s Language Outliers and the Adam Sandler flick Spanglish and to yet another Shakespeare play, this time the Taming of the Schrew--where the shrewd might see the same &quot;Spanglishebrew&quot; that I know really is the key to the Cypher--with the addition of the Periodic Table of the Elements and a few, very few initials and &quot;groups&quot; that give us nouns and verbs so that we can see entire sentences encoded in each and every word.<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace"><b>x</b></font> of billions of molecular keys we could be using for rapid storage and processing.&nbsp; The point is that long ago the idea of &quot;not having enough hard drive space to save your soul&quot; was actually a problem, and today all we have is a problem dealing with the truth; that if we cared about the system and about the fact that <b>our real scarce resource is truth</b> we would see that there&#39;s always been plenty of storage space available to make sure that every single branch of the vine could be saved forever and ever and ... (knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s obvious that whatever is going on, the Spirit of God is sort of forcing the wrong thing to happen&ndash;convincing everyone to be united in some ridiculous movement antithetical to anything they&rsquo;d ever have naturally done; and then sort of lacing it with &ldquo;stupid evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine you were not all &ldquo;thought police&rdquo; when this movie came out (now I add, for the very first time, when that would have made no sense, or been evil). Do you expect to all be &ldquo;clothing for sale&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Heavens&rdquo; &hellip; over and over and over (again)?

Explicitly, I think the &ldquo;notion&rdquo; that people (or the Earth) are clothing to be worn or sold like &hellip; for instance &ldquo;the girl in the red dress&rdquo; of the Adj Bureau and the Matrix is a sickness darker and worse than slavery&ndash;in fact hidden slavery and a hidden slave trade right before your eyes. It&rsquo;s pervasive though, and written deep into this story that takes us back generations here, and really defines what it means to be &ldquo;born in Hell&rdquo; when one of my two eary best friends called us a &ldquo;Baby Arcade&rdquo; around the years I spent at Horizon ELE ME NT A R Y school. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing it shouldn&rsquo;t take an army of people to free themselves (or the rest of the Universe from) but &ldquo;luckily&rdquo; it appears that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;C&rsquo;d&rdquo; here in EC (everyone see&hellip;) the CEDUAT &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="./IRMAX.html"><img alt="" sr./i.imgur.com/3w0PHjz.png" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course that tells me absolutely nothing about the pla<a href=".od.s.lamc.la">ce &quot;the Door</a>s&quot; were supposed to have brought us to&ndash;other than to see that what has returned appears to be sick and contaminated. It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The narrative has pre-Christian origins (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece" title="Golden Fleece">Jason and Medea</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_and_Andromeda" title="Perseus and Andromeda">Perseus and Andromeda</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon" title="Typhon">Typhon</a>, etc.),<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a> and is recorded in various saints&rsquo; lives prior to its attribution to St George specifically. It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The earliest narrative record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language" title="Georgian language">Georgian</a> text of the 11th century.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century.

The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Beauvais#Speculum_Historiale" title="Vincent of Beauvais">Speculum Historiale</a></em> and the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>. At first limited to the courtly setting of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance" title="Chivalric romance">Chivalric romance</a>, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and it has become an integral part of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George:_Devotions,_traditions_and_prayers" title="Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers">Christian traditions relating to Saint George</a> both in Eastern and Western tradition.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Silene in Libya was plagued by a venom-spewing <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon" title="European dragon">dragon</a> dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

I began to solidify my definition of &quot;TAT&quot; while in Los Angeles, a sort of fusion of &quot;turn around t&#39;s&quot; and the tattoo&#39;s that I see clearly as the key to the seal of the House of David in Psalms 22:22--the set of two tattoo&#39;s that grace Taylor&#39;s back in the Venusian &quot;<i>stone</i>&quot; realigning from &quot;SUS to SURAN&quot; from south to northeast; and the &quot;eye of Adam&quot; which is a clear corruption of the eyes of Ra/Horus changing the &quot;tear&quot; in the image to a grouping of stars similar to those depicted by the NASA logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s the &quot;TAT&quot; I see clearly defined in the name of my actual city of birth, Plantation--where I combine it with &quot;salutations&quot; and the word &quot;shoulder&quot; to comment clearly that it is with surety that the Eye and it&#39;s magic are responsible for the connection between Plantation and shoulder in the phrase &quot;plan to tattoo eye on shoulder,&quot; just as much as I can be sure it is the magic of the Eye that adds &quot;h&quot; to the <i>plan</i> of the word &quot;planet&quot; and connects it to the symbol &quot;eth&quot; in <b><i><font face="Courier New,

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

"><b>SOL</b></a>, his see our light, it starts with &ldquo;ALL&rdquo; and if you don&rsquo;t see HUMANITY is the only answer to the question of &ldquo;Men or AH?&rdquo; &hellip; well it&rsquo;s the only answer I will accept from the land that I hope appreciates as I do the bright shining light of the connection between the Statue of Liberty and the glowing ball of name-fire in the sky that reminds us that while the Sons of Liberty were slave owning misogynists it is the course of an increasingly beneficent history and the clear guiding hand of a time traveling God and Heaven that named them because of this day, this day where we achieve true freedom not just from the horrors of racism and jingoism and sexism but also from the hidden bondage of seeing that truly, truly, truly &ldquo;the race is not to Die Bold&rdquo; has won the election of the ages until we stand up and acknowledge that these technologies&mdash;that things like mind control and time travel will never, ever free us or help us to be free or better until we are publicly and opening working towards that goal.<br />

A few weeks ago, or maybe just a few days ago now (too) I spoke a little bit about how &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s God&rdquo; came and gave me &hellip; and those watching me &hellip; some informational updates that connected the idea of &ldquo;here and there&rdquo; and &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; to something like a connection between Heaven and helium.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spoke a little bit about the idea of people becoming Holodecks in a world where that might appear to those gazing through the forward looking safe-harbor telescope of Copernicus and connecting the idea of &ldquo;becoming one with God&rdquo; to a loss of individuality and failure to see that there is without doubt a reason &ldquo;you&rdquo; is the heart of the word &ldquo;future&rdquo; and it has absolutely everything to do with recognizing that in the spirit of Matchbox 20&rsquo;s &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little bit of something me&rdquo; in everything in history and that our collective failure to acknowledge that our lack of verbosity and forward movement &hellip; well it&rsquo;s a consequence of a trap door and a mean trick played on all of Creation by the initial written creator&rsquo;s key pen; this thing that forever ties Icarus and Arthur Pendragon and Jupiter to the &ldquo;just farokhing call a reporter already&rdquo; of the principal trade of the builders of Heaven, the carpenters of the &ldquo;Yessshua r guy.&rdquo;<br />

So here I am back in the land of SIAM and the House of YAMA having stopped for just a short moment in a place called Gibsonton &hellip; a place where the &ldquo;Ori&rdquo; of Florida and the &ldquo;AMP&rdquo; of turning around in Tampa coalesce around this repeatedly unanswered or unheard actual question to the age of Aquarius, &ldquo;ARE I YOU?&rdquo; quips Oriel (who would much prefer to be the &ldquo;him&rdquo; of Elisha defines Isaac&rsquo;s &ldquo;he laughs&rdquo;) who reminds the entirety of Creation that it is some very specific &ldquo;i&rsquo;s&rdquo; that really define what Oriel means to the people whose land has been saved from slavery and from darkness by their actions in response to stories written by people like Orson Scott Card and George Orwell and Orson Wells and &hellip; well, Aldous Huxley&mdash;because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;kiss of x&rsquo; that brings to light just how deeply ingrained the &ldquo;do the letter guy, game&rdquo; is in the mythology of &ldquo;Al in the Cupboard that at some point in time the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; will mean shine bright like the sun (rather than the idea of &ldquo;either/or&rdquo; that Dr. Anderson would remind you has absolutely nothing to do with ambiguous ambivalence or apathy &hellip; but rather a very clear inability to see the situational tragedy for what really has become the focal point of the fulcrum of the fall from rum to irrru) to everyone that&rsquo;s ever heard of or seen the name Florida or NORAD.<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />

<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

Not at all of note: I don&#39;t find significant at all my lack of interest in whether you believe the object of the question is God or Friend nor do I think it makes a difference at all in how I feel about myself or about you.&nbsp; It&#39;s the ICUS of Leviticus and perhaps of Spartacus that make the central turning point of the focal point of the encoded word &quot;<b><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">TORAH</font></b>&quot; to heart, and how.<br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />
<br />
... &quot;why is God suggesting we are lacking in individuality simply because we are all following the leader and tend to make decisions based solely on the uninformed opinions of others, especially many others?&quot;&nbsp; All others is probably a stretch, and perhaps &quot;no others&quot; but since nobody is saying anything it&#39;s very difficult to tell ... may be the exact truth.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s literally the word &quot;macaronic&quot; that I&#39;m going to call into question; it&#39;s one that I never knew before I needed to &quot;c&quot; it, and it&#39;s almost too perfect that nobody ever noticed that Yankee Doodle&#39;s &quot;macaroni&quot; has a very significant connection to the hidden cypher that ties together Stephen King&#39;s Language Outliers and the Adam Sandler flick Spanglish and to yet another Shakespeare play, this time the Taming of the Schrew--where the shrewd might see the same &quot;Spanglishebrew&quot; that I know really is the key to the Cypher--with the addition of the Periodic Table of the Elements and a few, very few initials and &quot;groups&quot; that give us nouns and verbs so that we can see entire sentences encoded in each and every word.<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />

What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,

<p style="text-align: justify;">It appears clear from here that you ahve no regard for your own well being, or the well being of others; nor would you even care if there clones of you in everyone else&rsquo;s holodeck or in Hitler&rsquo;s holo-gas-chamber being fed diseases and aged in The Princess Bride&rsquo;s &ldquo;guess what guys, this o<em>ne; this is it.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course that tells me absolutely nothing about the pla<a href=".od.s.lamc.la">ce &quot;the Door</a>s&quot; were supposed to have brought us to&ndash;other than to see that what has returned appears to be sick and contaminated. It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The narrative has pre-Christian origins (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece" title="Golden Fleece">Jason and Medea</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_and_Andromeda" title="Perseus and Andromeda">Perseus and Andromeda</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon" title="Typhon">Typhon</a>, etc.),<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a> and is recorded in various saints&rsquo; lives prior to its attribution to St George specifically. It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The earliest narrative record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_language" title="Georgian language">Georgian</a> text of the 11th century.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century. It reached <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Christianity" title="Western Christianity">Western Christian</a>tradition still in the 12th century, via the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades" title="Crusades">crusades</a>.

The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_of_Beauvais#Speculum_Historiale" title="Vincent of Beauvais">Speculum Historiale</a></em> and the <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>. At first limited to the courtly setting of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chivalric_romance" title="Chivalric romance">Chivalric romance</a>, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and it has become an integral part of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George:_Devotions,_traditions_and_prayers" title="Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers">Christian traditions relating to Saint George</a> both in Eastern and Western tradition.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Silene in Libya was plagued by a venom-spewing <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon" title="European dragon">dragon</a> dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

While often described as &ldquo;insectoid&rdquo;, the Formics are <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>, developed an <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton" title="Endoskeleton">internal skeleton</a> and shed most of their <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" title="Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" title="Respiration (physiology)">respire</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspire</a>. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, implications exist that &lsquo;workers&rsquo; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimorphism" title="Trimorphism">trimorphic</a> in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_Flight" title="Shadows in Flight">Shadows in Flight</a></em>.

Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> visible to humans.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder.

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">I envision a future sort of democracy built on &quot;many parties&quot; and a technological infastructure for defeating the Elephant and the Donkey and the &quot;two of everything God&#39;s Ark&quot; of ideas ... to actually build a technological governance system that aids the legislative process in coming up with solutions and ensuring that forward progress comes from the stagnatory soup of &quot;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron">me-ta</a> <a href="./FOUR.html">nada</a>&quot; that might be a timeline and &quot;all nations&quot; or maybe I&#39;m the only one talking about the beginning and the end of &quot;<em><a href="./HIGHERA.html">the name</a>.</em>&quot;</span></p>

I began to solidify my definition of &quot;TAT&quot; while in Los Angeles, a sort of fusion of &quot;turn around t&#39;s&quot; and the tattoo&#39;s that I see clearly as the key to the seal of the House of David in Psalms 22:22--the set of two tattoo&#39;s that grace Taylor&#39;s back in the Venusian &quot;<i>stone</i>&quot; realigning from &quot;SUS to SURAN&quot; from south to northeast; and the &quot;eye of Adam&quot; which is a clear corruption of the eyes of Ra/Horus changing the &quot;tear&quot; in the image to a grouping of stars similar to those depicted by the NASA logo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#39;s the &quot;TAT&quot; I see clearly defined in the name of my actual city of birth, Plantation--where I combine it with &quot;salutations&quot; and the word &quot;shoulder&quot; to comment clearly that it is with surety that the Eye and it&#39;s magic are responsible for the connection between Plantation and shoulder in the phrase &quot;plan to tattoo eye on shoulder,&quot; just as much as I can be sure it is the magic of the Eye that adds &quot;h&quot; to the <i>plan</i> of the word &quot;planet&quot; and connects it to the symbol &quot;eth&quot; in <b><i><font face="Courier New,

WE ARE NOT CONTENT with the state of the world, we are not happy living in a delusion, and the global response &hellip; or complete lack of actual discussion or acknowledgement of a message that will conclusively prove that we are living in the Matrix&mdash;the intent of it&rsquo;s existence, the Matrix; to give AIDS to our entire civilization, aids of nomenclature to help us see that nobody in their right mind would simulate disease and natural disaster in virtual reality&hellip; that it&rsquo;s really the heart of everyone, by design, to be the builders of Heaven.&nbsp; Or, maybe I should take my own advice and speak for myself&mdash;I am resolved, staring at the original lie and the scandal embedded in the word <i>HAMSTERDAM</i>, I am resolved that the the heart of Creation matches my own&mdash;that pain and disease should never be &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; and that continuing spinning that particular hamster&rsquo;s wheel is a heinous act.&nbsp;<br />

The &ldquo;<a href="./EVE.html
">to who</a>&rdquo; of the Tower of Power is obviously intended to answer the question raised by the Hebrew bad word for Kingdom, &ldquo;MAL, WHO TO?&rdquo; and it really should be clear that the answer inherently goes to those participating in self governance&mdash;something that appears to be absolutely ignored unilaterally here in this place.&nbsp; At least to me, it appears that there is a huge body of people aware of the lack of liberty and true democracy being presented to the world and doing absolutely not a thing to try and make that situation any better.

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So this spear&#39;s been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it&#39;s true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it&#39;s all the people saying &quot;me too, I&#39;m going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it&#39;s encoded with, that&#39;s the heart&#39;s desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can&#39;t hurt.<br />

So the tie to the Matrix (read as &quot;message, at are I ten, the heart of hearts, the home of the FLUX capacitor ... and the LAX airport ... and <i>the kiss</i> come to life&quot;) comes to reality in the key state of Tennessee which links the Roman numeral X to the heart of Nintendo and the acronym for Nintendo Entertainment System to the heart of Genesis.&nbsp; To really add some &quot;<a href="./FUCK.html

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

Personified by Hemera and reverse-anthropomorphized by Has&rsquo;hemesh; to say Hesperus is Phosphorus and the light of the words of the sun truly do bring day; well it&rsquo;s a dramatic understatement.&nbsp; The now hallowed and revered Hebrew for the special word is &ldquo;<b>YO M</b>&rdquo; and the name of the Jewish messianic &ldquo;single character&rdquo; echoes that very special &ldquo;yo&hellip; come on you guys&rdquo; in the ancient &ldquo;the the&rdquo; answering little Cindy-Who with &ldquo;El &hellip; El YO N.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

So we can almost see it hidden in the heart of Washington and in that very same place once we finally get over the story of Lot&rsquo;s wife in the heart of the Chinese and of their dragon too.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a small corruption of the actual truth today, but to see the magic wrought by &ldquo;<b>HI M</b>&rdquo; to really see it must be the very same as day; well, that&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll be sure.&nbsp; So those were the three words for &ldquo;day&rdquo; as in not Hell &hellip; rather than an endless cycle of unknown; <b>YO M</b>, <b>HO Y</b>, and <b>HI N</b>&hellip; and really what they all boil down to in the crucible of alphabet soup that we&rsquo;ve been born in is that seeing me and what I&rsquo;ve written; seeing this life and it&rsquo;s connection to history and to language and to religion, that&rsquo;s the very beginning of &ldquo;hi&rdquo; and the very beginning of turning a message into messengers.<br />
<br />
Hesperus is Phosphorus, <a href=".//OCADSWAY.html">per us</a> and <a href="./ADAMSROD.html
">for us,</a> and Has&#39;<a href="./HASHEMESHB.html
">heme</a>sh is <a href="./KA.html
">Heme</a>ra&hellip; and all together we answer a question that nobody ever acknowledged was plain as day, is the Egyptian god of the Sun the same &hellip; the same person or the same thing as the ancient King of all Gods; the deity known to the ancient Hebrews as El and to you, to you as &ldquo;him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Israel?&nbsp; These words tell me that&rsquo;s the truth laced in the message woven into the creation of language and civilization by our creator; that&rsquo;s what these words tell me&mdash;but truth be told the strange lack of honest communication and the wicked ignorance of our existence here today tell me something completely different.<br />
<br />
For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

<div align="justify">It literally took me two years to see &quot;DEFINITELY XXXY GATE&quot; in DEFLATE GATE; not just because of the missing space, and certainly not because I wasn&#39;t aware of &quot;DEF&quot; being a very K-RaD version of the undark... but more because the logical connections in my brain were physically being kept from firing.&nbsp; I literally couldn&#39;t see &quot;DEF LATE&quot; even though I was writing many, many emails from an address called &quot;<font size="-1">GILATE ATH SEPTEMBER2016 RUM COM</font>&quot; well after ... (and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s literally the word &quot;macaronic&quot; that I&#39;m going to call into question; it&#39;s one that I never knew before I needed to &quot;c&quot; it, and it&#39;s almost too perfect that nobody ever noticed that Yankee Doodle&#39;s &quot;macaroni&quot; has a very significant connection to the hidden cypher that ties together Stephen King&#39;s Language Outliers and the Adam Sandler flick Spanglish and to yet another Shakespeare play, this time the Taming of the Schrew--where the shrewd might see the same &quot;Spanglishebrew&quot; that I know really is the key to the Cypher--with the addition of the Periodic Table of the Elements and a few, very few initials and &quot;groups&quot; that give us nouns and verbs so that we can see entire sentences encoded in each and every word.<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace"><b>x</b></font> of billions of molecular keys we could be using for rapid storage and processing.&nbsp; The point is that long ago the idea of &quot;not having enough hard drive space to save your soul&quot; was actually a problem, and today all we have is a problem dealing with the truth; that if we cared about the system and about the fact that <b>our real scarce resource is truth</b> we would see that there&#39;s always been plenty of storage space available to make sure that every single branch of the vine could be saved forever and ever and ... (knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s obvious that whatever is going on, the Spirit of God is sort of forcing the wrong thing to happen&ndash;convincing everyone to be united in some ridiculous movement antithetical to anything they&rsquo;d ever have naturally done; and then sort of lacing it with &ldquo;stupid evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I imagine you were not all &ldquo;thought police&rdquo; when this movie came out (now I add, for the very first time, when that would have made no sense, or been evil).

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Jesus Christ Superstar</strong></em> is a 1970 <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_opera" title="Rock opera">rock opera</a> with music by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber" title="Andrew Lloyd Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> and lyrics by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Rice" title="Tim Rice">Tim Rice</a>. The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> and Jesus that are not present in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a>.</p>

While Judas loves Jesus, he believes that he is just a man, not God, and worries that his following will be seen as a threat to the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> which would severely punish Jesus, his associates, and possibly all Jewish people. Judas&rsquo;s warning goes unheeded, as Jesus&rsquo;s followers have their minds set on going to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with Jesus. As they ask Jesus for information about his plans for the future, Jesus will not give them any, since whatever will happen is determined by God (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Buzz?&rdquo;).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Formic species consists of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)" title="Group mind (science fiction)">hive-minded</a> colonies directed by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(insect)" title="Queen (insect)">queens</a>.

While often described as &ldquo;insectoid&rdquo;, the Formics are <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>, developed an <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton" title="Endoskeleton">internal skeleton</a> and shed most of their <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" title="Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" title="Respiration (physiology)">respire</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspire</a>. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, implications exist that &lsquo;workers&rsquo; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimorphism" title="Trimorphism">trimorphic</a> in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_Flight" title="Shadows in Flight">Shadows in Flight</a></em>. Drones are much smaller and depend on a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hive_Queen" title="The Hive Queen">Hive Queen</a> for survival, and their bodies are shaped to spend their lives clinging to her, until upon her death, they take flight to seek out a new queen. Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> visible to humans. In the first novel they have artificial lighting; whereas in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_Wiggin" title="Ender Wiggin">Ender</a> claims they rely on heat signature.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.

No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

">,</a> in a phrase or two, &ldquo;I know that if I am, then so are we&rdquo; ... for instance if this message is the end of Hell it&#39;s because you took action today and worked towards that goal. It&rsquo;s almost comikal to see things the other way, but as the Leaning Tower of Pisa clues us in and the Eiffel concurs in a sort of monumental census; in my heart of hearts I know that the answer to this Thursday&rsquo;s final quest of &hellip; what is the true Holy &ldquo;s&rdquo; &hellip; it&rsquo;s that plurality of Gods made from SOL; from seeing our light, and being the &ldquo;how&rdquo; that answer the &ldquo;why and&rdquo; of planet, how Heaven is built in a day.&nbsp;<br />

The Holy &ldquo;Ha&rdquo; of revolving around the rising &ldquo;r&rdquo; bouncing off the trampoline cocked state of the Matrix&rsquo;s 21 Jump Street &hellip; Piloting us to end cancer and world hunger and AIDS all at once, a flagship sort of conception of how exactly it is that the music (and the flicks!) will truly make us be.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;R&rdquo; that might mean &ldquo;are&rdquo; in a sois the &ldquo;es&rdquo; of Hades &hellip; is immortal .. or is divine &hellip; or it might mean &ldquo;our&rdquo; as in our home and our heart are one; and the whole thing rests on the natural reflexive response to one key piece of &ldquo;hidden information&rdquo; &hellip; the word tower means &ldquo;to who&rdquo; and the power comes from the words &ldquo;we are&rdquo; <a href="./YAT.html

<br />
Climbing the Tower of Babel, taking this hidden cypher and my difficult to grapple words &hellip; the key to the building of Heaven is seeing the idea of Silicon at the beginning of both silence and sight, and really understanding that the message we have and the desire of our hearts scream in a kind of disparate unison that &hellip;<br />

WE ARE NOT CONTENT with the state of the world, we are not happy living in a delusion, and the global response &hellip; or complete lack of actual discussion or acknowledgement of a message that will conclusively prove that we are living in the Matrix&mdash;the intent of it&rsquo;s existence, the Matrix; to give AIDS to our entire civilization, aids of nomenclature to help us see that nobody in their right mind would simulate disease and natural disaster in virtual reality&hellip; that it&rsquo;s really the heart of everyone, by design, to be the builders of Heaven.&nbsp; Or, maybe I should take my own advice and speak for myself&mdash;I am resolved, staring at the original lie and the scandal embedded in the word <i>HAMSTERDAM</i>, I am resolved that the the heart of Creation matches my own&mdash;that pain and disease should never be &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; and that continuing spinning that particular hamster&rsquo;s wheel is a heinous act.&nbsp;<br />

The &ldquo;<a href="./EVE.html
">to who</a>&rdquo; of the Tower of Power is obviously intended to answer the question raised by the Hebrew bad word for Kingdom, &ldquo;MAL, WHO TO?&rdquo; and it really should be clear that the answer inherently goes to those participating in self governance&mdash;something that appears to be absolutely ignored unilaterally here in this place.&nbsp; At least to me, it appears that there is a huge body of people aware of the lack of liberty and true democracy being presented to the world and doing absolutely not a thing to try and make that situation any better.

Probably somewhere in this vicinity I should point out the idea that perhaps our colloquial use of the word &quot;gate&quot; to refer to scandals (a la, not &quot;c&#39;ing Seagate&quot;) might also be interestingly related to &quot;dams&quot; like Amsterdam, Hamsterdam and Adam--and we might even see how these two things might connect for the Holy Sea(s) through the idea that perhaps gates and dams might relate to the idea ... of <i>locks</i>.&nbsp; There was some interesting commentary over the last few weeks related to airlocks and perhaps how they might function as a kind of safety layer allowing for more simple and safe traversal of gates or dams--I expect to delve into some more of the ideas related to <a href="./2017-07-22-roe-v-wade.html

So this spear&#39;s been rattled and shaken by Thanos and by Apocalypse to no end; the idea that we are sitting in the heart of Creation gazing at it&#39;s true purpose; to use the ascension from reality or simulated reality to a &quot;loving caring place called home&quot; that is the path to Heaven and the answer to the &quot;and how&quot; of Adamah and &quot;Planeth&quot; when we finally start getting down to what the heart of the plan really is, and in only two words it is the &quot;and how&quot; that unites &quot;eth&quot; and &quot;AH&quot; with us--answering with finality at least the &quot;why and&quot; of planet--it&#39;s all the people saying &quot;me too, I&#39;m going to help, also.&quot; With clarity and examples like Janet and Bet, for instance; following the pattern of the word itself answering the question or finishing the sentence it&#39;s encoded with, that&#39;s the heart&#39;s desire of the whole of Heart.&nbsp; It is to help us see we are &quot;how Heaven is built&quot; and see to there is a plan etched by us and through us everywhere we look, here on Earth.&nbsp; So one more time, for more clarity ... can&#39;t hurt.<br />

RoLOL, from the connection between Elisha and the Holy Superimposed name of God and the Angels&hellip; the Elohim it fairly clearly indicates that the original intent of said superimposition is to use the &ldquo;hello him&rdquo; that defines the heart of &ldquo;ever <b>YON</b> e&rdquo; &hellip; to overcome the loss of individuality and of self that most likely inherently came upon us &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; because of the throes and the unforeseeable affects of ideas like &ldquo;plugging Osiris (oh, I mean Siri) into your brain and believing that singular act gave you the ability to know everything&rdquo; and with some more insight we might see that the repeated attempts to overcome the Medusian story of a prototypical enemy that is in one place and time &ldquo;all and self&rdquo; in one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my clear intended purpose in the creation of the name Allol to show us this same superposition exists in the connection between the Jewish Shema (Adamic for &ldquo;name a&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID A&rdquo; in Floridian) and the Islamic Allah who told us ages and ages ago that the key to Revelation 5:5 and to Judah Maccabees&#39; <a href="./EVE.html

For those of us that know what &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hear&rdquo; means to me today, see there&rsquo;s something like magic connecting Israel and Rhea to our &ldquo;heart;&rdquo; and something that&rsquo;s orders of magnitude more important than a silly word for the place we call home; it&rsquo;s seeing the hilt of the cross; and seeing that acknowledging the truth leads to moving forward making the world a better place; and that anything else&hellip; anything else is beneath us.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It really is, staring at the world flounder around in some kind of wallowing and self-pity for the &ldquo;horrors of this place&rdquo; that have brought you to me; with this misguided belief that it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m responsible for them or I&rsquo;m going to make them go away&mdash;or that I must be so disfigured and grotesque to look at that rather than act of your own volition and see the world for what it really is &hellip; that you think you and everyone around you will blame your collective inaction on the &ldquo;single point of failure&rdquo; you must know by now, is you.<br />
<br />
I don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way, though it&rsquo;s impossible to tell if that&rsquo;s what happens whenever anyone gazes into my Hazel eyes or comes across the endless reasons we shouldn&rsquo;t be stuck in a place designed to prove to the Universe that nobody in their right mind would ever say or think that &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; was anything short of Hell as soon as they found out what it means they could be doing instead.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the comeuppance or the over-commence not just of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; of the idea that&rsquo;s an act of nature or an act of God or even the hidden fabled poor excuse for doing nothing that we call a total lack of consensus beginning with zero communication and forgetting what it means to &ldquo;be a pen&rdquo; or a hand, or an eye, or &hellip; or the &ldquo;majority being blamed for not receiving the message of the&nbsp; minority and reporting&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />

Pertinent to the recent flurry of semi-gibernaccious (that&rsquo;s &ldquo;not gibberish&rdquo; for those of you that don&rsquo;t speak Yiddish or Fibonacci) is my attempt to explain to this reader base and to the much larger group that it (or I?) apparently reaches that while I do see tacit acknowledgement of my existence and response to a good deal of the words that I speak; the response I see appears to be lacking intelligence because of it&rsquo;s intentional and misguided indirect and obscure nature&mdash;something which does appear to be driven by a similar &ldquo;indirectness&rdquo; embodying the force of Darkness which allowed for such a blatant and obvious message to be hidden in every single word we speak and every sign we see.&nbsp; What appears obvious now is that in a sort of comedic or perhaps tragic homage to the obscure style of the original hidden message and strange method of communication&mdash;the rather bountiful &ldquo;acknowledgement&rdquo; comes across as neither an ACK or a NAK and the greatest and most import step forward, action, has yet to be taken.<br />

Why humanity does not see, or appears to be completely unable to break through with clarity, is that a blanket and universal lack of acknowledgement or public discussion of this message is clear and undeniable proof of the enslavement of our entire species, of the entire world; that&rsquo;s basically the question I&rsquo;d really like to elicit an answer to from this reader base.&nbsp; Bluntly, what is keeping you from explaining to me what piece of &ldquo;missing information&rdquo; makes the inaction of the government, of religious authorities, and of the free press something that is to undeniably requiring immediate attention and remedy?<br />

<div align="justify">Over the course of the last few years my understanding of &quot;how to read&quot; this hidden cypher and what certain specific definitions mean have changed slightly, and very often with important reasons or effects as we&#39;ve moved through a very structured and designed path.&nbsp; In the earliest days of this Revelation I had a special &quot;Only Adam&quot; meaning for the difference between &quot;a&#39;s and o&#39;s&quot; in words--specifically coming from the Ha of Isaac and the Pa that exists somewhere else in Abraham&#39;s namekey to the 2 letter references to spirit and body and child and parent that unite a great many words for places and names important to religion and the story under the auspieces of the concepts of Ka and Ba that connect Egyptian mythological concepts of body and spirit to modern places like the Bahamas and stories of the Promised Land like Willy Wonka and maybe even names like Picard and Riker and Kirk and Uhura.&nbsp; The &quot;a&quot; was originally &quot;alive&quot; as in Johnny 5 and &quot;in the <i>progenitor</i> Universe&quot; in reality.&nbsp; Rather than Ho and Ha; of which I really see almost no difference in preference of connotation and significantly more &quot;heroic names&quot; linked to Hosea and Horus and Home and ... but the loss of the &quot;a&quot; of Pa hurt more, even though I don&#39;t think it belongs to me or hurt me.&nbsp;<br />

It was the phrase &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier,
monospace" size="-1"><b>HOCUS POCUS</b></font>&quot; which gave me initiial insight into the reason for the loss of reality and the more victorious sounding two letter ensembles; specifically the idea that &quot;magic&quot; has a special meaning in the context of virtual reality vs. simulated or actual reality--that it&#39;s quite literally <i>the difference</i> between the two; and perhaps the cause, or the reason words like &quot;I picked you up and put you back on solid ground&quot; might relate to how and why we&#39;ve come to this strange crossroads.&nbsp; The &quot;CUS&quot; was something like &quot;C the victorious US of VE&quot; which stands for Victorious Earth in my reading of those letters in places like Norse myth and Venus and Love; it tied also to the &quot;Us&#39;s&quot; of Amicus and specifically of Prometheus and Uranus and Jesus--and also to the &quot;us&quot; in the heart of Yusuf.<br />
<br />
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font size="-1">Obviously with a system like that--something to aid the voter base in understanding the intricacies of details for a broad range of products whomever it is that controls &quot;the truth&quot; really does hol the keys to nearly every vote--you know, anything outside the range of the ridiculous, like &quot;should the blind lead the blind? Y/N&quot;<br />
<br />
I envision a system of collaborative competition sort of writing these truth tables that eventually turn into something like an Alexa or O<b>siri</b> that you can <i>really trust</i>;&nbsp; it takes time and active involvement and really wanting the right outcome for yourse<b>lv</b>es and the common good--I see a system that rejects outright misinformation, un-facts or opinions based on non-factual information, and rejects logical falsities as a core system function ... then later something that colors levels of belief based whether or not specific &quot;articles&quot; are intended to be objective and unbiased or persuasive, or without opinion at all.&nbsp; Detail of data, how it&#39;s been summarized; all of those things contribute to bias and allow for the wizards to nudge popular onion one way or another, some facts will change over time or other scope (like species, for instance)--all those things need to be taken into account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
For all these reasons it&#39;s really important to see that at the most basic level, what we have here in this place connecting the ancient Greek name of Demosthenes to Ender&#39;s Game and to the phrase &quot;demos the NES&quot; in the few days of work I did in 2013 <b><tt><i>explain the game to <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">m</font>e</i></tt></b> world.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that the truth here when it comes to mind altering technology and it&#39;s effect on what we see as true and false and obvious or hidden... those most basic things are being hidden through a sort of &quot;hidden terrorist cell group effort&quot; that itself is using this hidden technology to organize the darkness and keep even the people directly involved from realizing exactly what it is they&#39;re hiding--their own slavery--from themselves.&nbsp; Breaking this thing, here in this place, that&#39;s the very first step to freeing not only now but forevermore from the darkness of what we&#39;re about to really understand is where we&#39;ve come from--and because of that something we have an obligation to ourselves and to our future, really to the entire Universe to help ensure doesn&#39;t ever happen again.</font></font><br />

ERRATA, on the idea that &quot;friend&quot; means &quot;my mother&quot; or &quot;a mother&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; or &quot;reliable&quot; those appear to be the definitions for &quot;AMI&quot; returning from google translate and from some other strangely &quot;not what I just wrote&quot; source.&nbsp; In addition, the Strong&#39;s concordance appears to be suggesting that &quot;merea&quot; is the actual Hebrew for &quot;friend.&quot;&nbsp; Frances Bean, I think it&#39;s a farokhing setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; In related etymological research, I&#39;ve found that those same three letters mean &quot;water&quot; in Latin, as in... Still Water, the focal bet of Almost Famous... and what appears to be a sharp two edged sword in relation to the &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; relating to the &quot;first plague&quot; of turning water to blood and seeing it means &quot;the multitude to family&quot; ... perhaps we&#39;re seeing &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;mommy&quot; in addition to &quot;blood is thicker than water&quot; and<br />

<br />
In an odd twist of events I just remembered that the actual Hebrew for &quot;mother&quot; is &quot;Ima&quot; because personal reasons.&nbsp; Great confusion if the concordance agrees... and this really throws a wrench in the last few paragraphs.&nbsp; Hopefully we won&#39;t find that it has anything to do with ...</div>

(and during, by the way) Christmas of 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The day marked a very special event for me--it was a sort of fulcrum in a series of tragic failures to vacate premises (otherwise known as &quot;trespasses&quot;) something I surely do hope to be given credit for &quot;adding some light manifestation to&quot; if not just to point out once again the phrase &quot;on Earth, as it is... the Earth is actually inside Heaven&quot; as one of those same kinds of phrases that you might take one way ... as any normal person saying the Lord&#39;s Prayer ever would have ... or another way after hearing some added letters spoken aloud (go ahead, try) &quot;as it is <i><b>in</b></i> Heaven.&quot;<br />

It&#39;s possible that just like &quot;AMI&quot; appears in my mind to have changed .... really just today, that Macaroni used to only refer to &quot;the Wontan&quot; (from &quot;an&quot; I <i>imagine</i>) I said was definitely a little too wanton and certainly at this point not to be confused with a wonton; but it&#39;s more likely that the &quot;Gift of the Magi&quot; here is telling us something about the the &quot;MA&quot; modifier (which is basically a &quot;Matrix to Now&quot; <b>MY </b>&quot;car&quot; most likely refers to a time fork around 2001 when I may or may not have failed to survive a car accident in a past portion of the &quot;vine&quot; that was alit; one that contributes significantly to this message by tying Joseph (and Barbara!) McCarthy and John Nash&#39;s (because &quot;for the common good is a mathematically logical superiority to &quot;free market capitalism&quot; or whatever you call what we pretend is in control here) <b><i>red ties</i></b><i> </i>that he saw following him around in a way that makes me pretty sure that along with James Jesus Angleton we&#39;ve got two great movies that present &quot;<i>the</i> Witnesses of the Tribulation&quot; in a way that really explains how the faux battle between communism and democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For clarity, it&#39;s very possible that a significant number of changes were made to our &quot;history&quot; in a way that did not affect our souls--our memories because that would re-run ... the whole thing; that little things like <a href="./THREETAG.html
"><b>Enver Hoxha</b></a> could be added retroactively and then shielded from inspection through the idea that &quot;you just didn&#39;t <i>understand</i> <b>definitely late</b>&quot; ... until you realize, you know... that we do have another fundamentally scarce resource also ties to the &quot;missing truth&quot; nobody really seems to care about themselves.&nbsp; It&#39;s not as hard to understand in a place where you might have pretended not to hear that the fake planets not being printed in reality like every time the background music played the crack of a &quot;Babe Ruth baseball flying out the park&quot; really meant that another copy of you would have (been) born (or the labor of having to overcome ...), and lived nearly exactly the same life ... and kind-of missed that &quot;planet clones&quot; and timeline forks are the kinds of things that you really wouldn&#39;t want to have happen ... well, at a low point.<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>With more &quot;get clear on this&quot; stuff; you probably wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where all the memories of your soul are somehow incompatible with what you see around you--for instance, you wouldn&#39;t want to wake up in a place where you were a slave your entire life and &quot;just didn&#39;t care&quot; and then all of a sudden start caring about something like that, and think &quot;wow, I must have been really stupid when that guy what trying to help me not be a slave...&quot;</blockquote>
<br />
Just for instance, immediately after we have 4 days weekends beginning and sexat (that&#39;s ... <i>not taxes</i>!) checks coming in from the Confederate and the Federal Reserve(s) and from our employers; well, that would be a significantly better time to think about whether or not you might want to be two of you--and whether or not the two of you talking to each other would be something of a &quot;clue&quot; as to whether or not you&#39;d be qualified to vote in a census about whether or not you exist.&nbsp; I mean, it would be significantly better than doing it a decade ago, and going through &quot;the apocalypse&quot; over and over again.&nbsp; Just for instance.&nbsp; Defining what&#39;s morally acceptable really comes down to seeing whether or not you care ... about yourself or something just like you--and you can see clearly in places like Black Mirror that these questions are being posed to us, but it&#39;s not really as clear as ... would you want to be Boba Fett--and have an army of <i>just you</i> ... fighting ... <i>just you</i> ... for control of the MadaMverse, for instance?<br />
<br />
When we start looking at it, there&#39;s grey areas and more questions and significantly more ... you involved ... that&#39;s going to need to go into whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget about the 10 hours you spent analyzing &quot;gin&quot; references in language only to find there&#39;s not a single significant connection to the words &quot;let it be gin&quot; outside of of the adaverse.&nbsp; At whether or not it&#39;s OK to forget to record that those 10 hours were boiled down to &quot;checked every word of every Sagitarian Galactic language and only found &#39;begin&#39;&quot; well, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic"><font face="Comic Sans MS">there&#39;s 13 mor</font> e languages now; and yo</a>u&#39;ll never know which ones they are.&nbsp; That&#39;s a joke, by the way, if you don&#39;t remember it&#39;s the <a href="./GATE.html
"><i>You and I</i></a> verse, that&#39;s the <b>heart</b> of <a href="./2017-06-08-kismet-kiss-me-taylor.html
"><i>UNI</i></a>.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d probably care, right, if 4000 years passed by during the time you thought was just the last 17; <i>you&#39;d care</i> if you knew, right?&nbsp; Would you care if everyone else thought it was just 400?<br />
<br />
40 then.&nbsp; I&#39;m pre<a href="./THREETAG.html
">tty sur</a>e it&#39;s just 4-D years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the light of day; the point is we&#39;d probably rather be hearing about Ceres and about the pool&#39;s of the King and Zelda&#39;s Fairy and Coccoon&#39;s warm fuzzies and Mila Kinus&#39;s outer and inner beauty all being sort of &quot;parfectod artfully&quot; in that way that you can make a porfect brain for any set of memories--well, maybe a few pirfect versions ... depending on optimizations.<br />
<br />
The point of course is that&#39;s very possible to engineer changes in the world--even in our memories; we could wake up tomorrow literally in the <a href=".ww.youtube.com/watch?v=7KtAgAMzaeg"><i>MadaMverse</i></a> with thousands of tiny Adam&#39;s floating around us and think it was some kind of strange thing called &quot;the Force&quot; ... you could wake up on Venice Beach or Ipanema, in a place filled with green girls that don&#39;t know what clothes are ... but ... we&#39;d do anything like that, because that&#39;s Hell--and nobody in their right mind would ever make Hell.<br />

I&#39;ve said it a few times, you&#39;re looking at an idiological battle spoken of as good vs. evil in what is really a &quot;government of the people&quot; vs. a &quot;government of the workers&quot; of which we can see clearly here the Corporation has won.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean that in a sort of &quot;<i>Die Bold</i>&quot; won the election sense, in a way where the financial benefit to private business has literally derailed the idea of &quot;representative democracy&quot; through campaign contributions literally controlling the outcomes of elections and of legislation through what is ... the defined current system ... &quot;the right thing&quot; to do the way our government is set up is to cater ... to the individual profit line of insurance carriers (for instance) rather than creating a sort of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace" size="-1">RED SHIELD</font>&quot; ... a Federal insurer of last resort that would very quickly show us all how much &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; lowers the total cost of insurance and individual premiums to nearly nothing.&nbsp; That one thing, the &quot;shield&quot; here just shows us how obvious it is that this what we should be doing--it would be financially advantageous to every single person in the Universe as well as the Federal government (and even the individual insurers would probably stop having to pay 700 dollars every time I have to do a urinalysis)

<div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The bottom line, when it comes to things like the &quot;render to Caesar what the Holy Sea is due&quot; is to see that in that name is the same backwards nearly parted sea that&#39;s in the very first &quot;word&quot; that I called the word--the one that shows the English word for &quot;sea&quot; parted in the Hebrew word for the Holy Fire that emanates from the Eternal Flame and the Shinning Bush of Exodus.... the bottom line is that this Revelation shows that we have an immediate surplus, a significant surplus of resources that takes the phrase &quot;taxation is theft&quot; and makes it insanity... at we should be operating like one of those Indian Casino&#39;s doling out thousands to their members ... because they&#39;re paying for public education and still making billions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What we aren&#39;t seeing is that the lack of truth and reality in our &quot;resource scarcity&quot; here, the fact that there&#39;s never a food shortage or a land shortage or an oil shortage in virtual reality ... it&#39;s hiding that the system is screwing itself into the Downward Spiral of not being able to properly manage system resources like &quot;electrical power&quot; and &quot;compute power&quot; and &quot;storage space&quot; because being able to do those things would un-hide the fact that at this level of virtualization and darkness it&#39;s probably impossible to even begin to relate &quot;oil and light&quot; or to see that we&#39;ve failed to properly integrate the DNA storage paradigm <i>in the beginning </i>here, using the similar small alphabet that<br />
&quot;biology donated to Microsoft&quot; and failing to see that what we really have is a clue that compute power and storage space are <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><b>tens</b></font> (<font size="-2">i found it</font>) of orders of magnitude weaker or less robust than they could be if we only used a handful of atoms or the <font face="Courier New, Courier,

(knowing what I know about the system builder) that&#39;s probably really what we have at the heart of the crossroads of Krypton and Cybertron.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&rsquo;s obvious that whatever is going on, the Spirit of God is sort of forcing the wrong thing to happen&ndash;convincing everyone to be united in some ridiculous movement antithetical to anything they&rsquo;d ever have naturally done; and then sort of lacing it with &ldquo;stupid evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence&ndash;on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security&ndash;and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an outright invasion. Even if the invaders appear to be the unanimous population of the invaded&ndash;it is a total invasion resulting in a total loss of life, morality and the culture that ones brought us to &ldquo;immortality without immorality.&rdquo; It is a new kind of warfare and a new kind of weapon&ndash;and to change your desires and your beliefs in such a way that you can&rsquo;t even notice&ndash;or you think &ldquo;coveting forever&rdquo; for instance is a good reason to fight to the death to ensure you can also be tortured forever&ndash;you&rsquo;ve literally lost everything, here, in this &ldquo;single Biblical dayvpeek.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My functional understanding of t<a href=".ylife.s.lamc.la">hi s &ldquo;clothes&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; bat</a>tle, which is also encoded in the generations of my personal family line prior to now has changed significantly because of the broad and ubiquitous insane response to this message. I now assume that &ldquo;clothing&rdquo; in this context must have somehow included your &ldquo;minds&rdquo; in what I&rsquo;ve tried to explain appears to be something like &hellip; God&rsquo;s mind &hellip; &ldquo;thinking like a flye&rdquo; though as you can see I&rsquo;m no longer sure how ore when that hpapened. It appears here, as I&rsquo;ve said; to have been done too rapidly&ndash;and in complete silence&ndash;something that should raise questions, flags, and sincere discussion. Instead though, I have a planet full of people that don&rsquo;t seem to care about the simulation of disease an absolute prerequisite to &ldquo;flying, e (as in leaving, ever)&rdquo; nor about the mass starvation of children or the completely backwards medical and medical services industries which literally fail on purpose to use the available information.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">E should see&ndash;and I mean you, e is proof that schizophrenia and a number of other neurological problems are literally an attack, warfare, something that needs to be fought, not treaded with &ldquo;weaponized hospitalization.&rdquo; Along those [same lines, <a href="./MIDAS.html">my &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; life story and the connections bet</a>ween it an <a href="">the life of Christ</a>, Samson, and a number of other key story points show how this same movement has weaponized jails and the criminal justice system in such a way that&rsquo;s literally taken away any of its benefits and turned it into a sick machine of Hellish torture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s truly even worse than an invasion, what I&rsquo;m looking at is a hostile invasion of intentional ignorance and stupidity designed to destroy the forward progress of biological life&ndash;in what appears to be some kind of game or implied desire to &ldquo;pretend yourselves into reality&rdquo; doing everything wrong&ndash;pretending away all the things that would have made an advanced civilization of this disclosure. <em>To hell</em> with that idea, and this movement.</p>

It appears to be the reason JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>covet</em> means&rdquo; were such an aptly chosen term, and as I&rsquo;ve pointed out nuemrous times the &ldquo;Silence&rdquo; appears to be nothing more than a mechanism to keep inequality and unfair treatment &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; as in, you&rsquo;ll never know if you got the same deal, the best deal, or any deal at all compared to to the next guy&ndash;of which we still won&rsquo;t be able to tell if he and/or you have been sold into slavery or some hidden and sick(er sicker than here) game with a more morbid theme than &ldquo;end world hunger, heal the sick, build playland&rdquo; &hellip; not happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">The legend of <strong>Saint George and the Dragon</strong> describes the saint taming and slaying a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering. The narrative is set in <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)" title="Cappadocia (Roman province)">Cappadocia</a> in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Africa" title="Diocese of Africa">Libya</a> in the 13th-century <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Legend" title="Golden Legend">Golden Legend</a></em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon#cite_note-Watley2004-1">[1]</a></span></p>

It was particularly attributed to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Theodore_Tiro" title="Saint Theodore Tiro">Saint Theodore Tiro</a> in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Silene in Libya was plagued by a venom-spewing <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_dragon" title="European dragon">dragon</a> dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&rsquo;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the populace.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Jesus Christ Superstar</strong></em> is a 1970 <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_opera" title="Rock opera">rock opera</a> with music by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber" title="Andrew Lloyd Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> and lyrics by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Rice" title="Tim Rice">Tim Rice</a>. The musical started as a rock opera <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</a> before its <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</a>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels&rsquo; accounts</a> of the last week of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>&rsquo;s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</a> in Jerusalem and ending with the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</a>. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a> and Jesus that are not present in the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The work&rsquo;s depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is both dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples and also fearful for the harm that may result.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera&rsquo;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronism" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a>.</p>

While Judas loves Jesus, he believes that he is just a man, not God, and worries that his following will be seen as a threat to the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> which would severely punish Jesus, his associates, and possibly all Jewish people. Judas&rsquo;s warning goes unheeded, as Jesus&rsquo;s followers have their minds set on going to <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with Jesus. As they ask Jesus for information about his plans for the future, Jesus will not give them any, since whatever will happen is determined by God (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Buzz?&rdquo;).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Formics</strong>, also known as <strong>Buggers</strong>, are a fictional ant-like <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien species</a> from the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_series" title="Ender's Game series">Ender&rsquo;s Game series</a> of science fiction novels by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card" title="Orson Scott Card">Orson Scott Card</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the novel <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>, the Formics attacked Earth a few generations before the novel begins. They attempted to colonise the planet and were barely fought off by a New Zealand soldier known as <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazer_Rackham" title="Mazer Rackham">Mazer Rackham</a>. The first book in the series, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, largely stems from the human quest to defend themselves from this species, although the Formics ultimately turn out as victims, with the first attack being an accident due to differing biology.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &ldquo;Formic&rdquo; is derived from <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formica" title="Formica">formica</a></em>, the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant" title="Ant">ant</a></em>; whereas &ldquo;bugger&rdquo; is a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> used by humans; yet it was not until 1999&rsquo;s <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Shadow" title="Ender's Shadow">Ender&rsquo;s Shadow</a></em> that the term &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; was first used, interchangeably with &lsquo;Bugger&rsquo;. Later books used &lsquo;Formic&rsquo; almost exclusively, as the more &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; term. This leads to odd scenarios in the continuity of the books, such as Valentine referring to them as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_eg">[1]</a> chronologically next as &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_in_Exile" title="Ender in Exile">Ender in Exile</a></em>,<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_ex">[2]</a> and again as &ldquo;Buggers&rdquo; in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> and <em>Xenocide</em>.<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formics#endnote_xn">[3]</a> The <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game_(film)" title="Ender's Game (film)">feature film adaptation of <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> uses &ldquo;Formics&rdquo; exclusively.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Formic species consists of <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)" title="Group mind (science fiction)">hive-minded</a> colonies directed by <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(insect)" title="Queen (insect)">queens</a>. In <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender's Game">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyrum_Graff" title="Hyrum Graff">Graff</a> described them as being an insect that &ldquo;could have evolved on earth, if things had gone a different way a billion years ago,&rdquo; and that their evolutionary ancestors could have looked similar to Earth&rsquo;s ants. While often described as &ldquo;insectoid&rdquo;, the Formics are <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warm-blooded" title="Warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>, developed an <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endoskeleton" title="Endoskeleton">internal skeleton</a> and shed most of their <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton" title="Exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>, evolved a complex system of internal organs, and they <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiration_(physiology)" title="Respiration (physiology)">respire</a> and <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration" title="Perspiration">perspire</a>. If a queen dies, all the workers under her control lose their ability to function immediately; but in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, implications exist that &lsquo;workers&rsquo; can escape the influence of a queen. The Formic race is revealed to be <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimorphism" title="Trimorphism">trimorphic</a> in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_in_Flight" title="Shadows in Flight">Shadows in Flight</a></em>. Drones are much smaller and depend on a <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hive_Queen" title="The Hive Queen">Hive Queen</a> for survival, and their bodies are shaped to spend their lives clinging to her, until upon her death, they take flight to seek out a new queen. Drones are capable of individual thought and action as well as mind-to-mind communication, more limited than that of a queen; whereas queens communicate instantaneously and can even do so with other species. Formics live in vast underground colonies, usually without light, informing the assumption that Formics make use of sensory apparatus outside the range of the <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum" title="Electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a> visible to humans. In the first novel they have artificial lighting; whereas in <em><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocide" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></em>, <a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender_Wiggin" title="Ender Wiggin">Ender</a> claims they rely on heat signature.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;<b>Thou shalt not steal</b>&quot; is one of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a><sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a>&nbsp;(and by extension the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>), which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">&quot;Steal&quot; in this commandment has traditionally been interpreted by&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_commentaries_on_the_Bible" title="Jewish commentaries on the Bible">Jewish commentaries</a>&nbsp;to refer to the stealing of an actual human being, that is, to&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping" title="Kidnapping">kidnapping</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking" title="Human trafficking">human trafficking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_steal#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;With this understanding, a contextual translation of the commandment in Jewish tradition would more accurately be reflected as &quot;<b>Thou shalt not kidnap</b>&quot;, with kidnapping being a&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capital_crimes_in_the_Torah" title="List of capital crimes in the Torah">capital offence</a>&nbsp;and thus included among the Ten Commandments.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Nevertheless, and especially in non-Jewish traditions, the commandment has come to commonly and colloquially be understood or interpreted to prohibit the unauthorized taking of&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft" title="Theft">theft</a>, which is a wrongful action that does not ordinarily incur the death penalty and is prohibited elsewhere in the&nbsp;<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible" title="Hebrew Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;"><a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides" title="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>&nbsp;(the Rambam) viewed stealing as one step in the progression from covetous desire to murder. When the person who owns a coveted item resists its unjust acquisition, the thief resorts to violence and may become guilty of murder.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href=".n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Micah" title="Book of Micah">Mikha</a>&nbsp;2:2) [Micah 2:2], &#39;They covet fields and (then) steal them.&#39; And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">While private property rights are affirmed, the overriding theme in the New Testament is that one should trust and hope in God rather than in one&#39;s material possessions, and there is an acknowledgement of a struggle in the heart between loving God and loving money. It is said that &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils&quot; (1 Timothy 6:6-10). And also:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;">Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ... No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span></p>

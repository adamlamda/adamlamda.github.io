      Once you have registered, just send email from your normal email
      address (the address you put in the email box above) and the
      system will take care of anonymizing your return address for
      you.

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      The Berkman mostly anonymous remailing service allows users
      transparently to exchange emails with one another without
      knowing each others' email addresses and without revealing real
      email addresses in the process.  Instead of merely forwarding
      the email to the anonymous recipient, the remailer replaces the
      address of the sender with her own anonymous address before
      remailing the message out to the real address of the recipient.
      This process allows correspondants to communicate anonymously
      with one another with their existing email accounts, removing
      the burden on the user of having to configure her desktop client
      to read and send email from a new account.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system is <i>mostly</i> anonymous because the systems
      maintains a list that associates real and anonymous addresses,
      as well as a log of emails sent, making it possible for the
      administrator of the system to determine the real address of a
      given message.  You can trust the anonymity of the system as
      much as you trust the administrator of the system (in this
      case, the Berkman Center).
    </p>

    <p>
      The best way to describe the remailer is to step through the
      process the system goes through with each email:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
	When an email is received with an anonymous address
	(anon_ms@eon.law.harvard.edu) as the <i>recipient</i>, the
	system first tries to look up the anonymous address that
	corresponds to the real address (stevejobs@apple.com) of
	the <i>sender</i>.
      </li>
      <li>
	If the system does not have an anonymous address that
	corresponds to the real address of the sender, the email is
	returned to the sender with a note informing the sender that
	he must have an anonymous address registered with the system
	to use the remailer.
      </li>
      <li>
	If the system does have an anonymous address that corresponds
	to the real address of the sender, the system replaces the
	real address of the <i>sender</i> with the anonymous address
	of the <i>sender</i> and remails the message to the real
	recipient address.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The end result of the above process is that Joe can send an
      email from his normal email account to an anonymous address and
      know that not only will the address be delivered to the intended
      recipient, but the mail will look as if it has come from Joe's
      anonymous address.  The recipient can likewise respond to Joe's
      anonymous address from his normal account and know that Joe will
      receive the email but will only see the anonymous sending
      address.
